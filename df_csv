STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2021
The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 January 2021.
Business review
Due to Covid-19, the historically core retail operation of sales to visitors to the unique retail location in Perthshire,
Scotland did not produce the majority of the turnover. For the first year since the company opened for business in 1995,
the revenue generated from direct shopping channels exceeded that of traditional retail.
With the exception of the Food Hall, the retail departments were closed from March 23rd until June 29th and then
operated on a reduced and restricted basis throughout the year until closing again on Christmas Eve 2020.
The direct shopping channels were very successful throughout the entire year resulting in increased employment in the
last quarter and extending to a shift pattern of nearly 24 hours of despatch per day. As the retail departments were quiet,
team members were reallocated to the distribution centre located at Ballinluig.
The House of Bruar continue to promote some of Britain's finest produce, clothing and rural artwork. Within the various
different halls you will find items ranging from traditional Scottish tweed to cashmere knitwear and locally sourced
foodstuffs.
Financial key performance indicators
The traditional key performance indicators were maintained during the pandemic, but more concentration was placed on
aspects such as cash flow, retention of employment, supply chain management, stock control and the ever changing
government policies.
Given that the company remained profitable and the turnover decreased by lees than 10% from £32.5m to £29.4m, with a
reduction in the closing stock and good control of overheads, which was made possible by the job retention scheme, the
company is pleased with the results for the year to 31st January 2021.
Other key performance indicators
Our income is mainly generated from two distinct sources: over the counter sales and direct shopping. A key indicator of
over the counter sales which is monitored daily is the number of visitors to the store. This is achieved by the use of a
counter on the car parks and during the year to 31 January 2021, the number of vehicles visiting the site decreased due
to lockdown restrictions imposed on the organisation.
Counter sales are also monitored daily against the same day of the previous calendar year, gross profit is monitored on a
weekly basis and operating profit on a month by month basis.
Direct sales are monitored by reviewing the quantity of orders, the average value of orders placed and the average
number of units per order on a daily basis. These values include orders generated by catalogues, off the page adverts
and digital channels. The latter of which has grown significantly over the past few years.
The balance sheet has remained stable and turnover of the business continues to improve.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2021
Future opportunities
There continues to be an increasing demand for House of Bruar branded merchandise at retail and more significantly on
the internet and via mail order. This is enhanced by the promotion of world famous brands offered via all channels to the
customer. The growth in the use of the internet for shopping due to Covid-19 has increased the future opportunities of the
business and opened up international markets.
The ease of price comparison on the internet is both a threat and an opportunity. Customers are able to benchmark all
products online very casily and the purchase decision can be very price focussed. In turn this means that the theatre
aspect of retail is more important as well as a difference in the product range. The House of Bruar is well placed to take
advantage of the market position.
The ambition of long term relationships continues throughout all aspects of the business. Whilst this is an obvious
statement for the relationship with staff members and customers, it is also true for suppliers and sub contractors. The
House of Bruar is very proud of the fact that several suppliers have been with the company since the inception 26 years
ago.
The future planning for the A9 dualling continues, although a specific start dates for the sections that cover The House of
Bruar shop and the Ballinluig Distribution Centre have not been finalised. It is the belief of the company that, once
completed, the A9 will allow more people to visit Highland Perthshire and further north on a safer road.
During the disruptive construction phase of the A9, the business needs to expand the direct shopping elements of the
operation. The core of mail order fulfilment operations has moved from the main site to Ballinluig, which will aid the
progression to a multi-season mail order business. There is already a requirement for further expansion of the distribution
site, which may be hindered by the delays in the A9 improvements.
With the development of electric vehicles, there are plans to create a charging hub at Bruar, which will incorporate
chargers of various speeds. Investigations are underway to assess the viability of using power generated from a
neighbouring hydro electric scheme.
Covid - 19
The pandemic has continued to cause significant disruption during the 2021, with the retail departments being closed for
the first four months of the year. Whilst not necessarily financially productive, the company policy has been to open every
department at the first opportunity and to remove the need for furlough as quickly as possible.
Covid-19 continues to create problems with several aspects of the business from the supply chain to team members.
However the company will return to strong profitability and already has a stronger balance than as at 31st January 2020.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2021
Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006
The Directors of the Company must act in accordance with a set of personal duties. These duties are detailed in s172 of
the UK Companies Act 2006 summarised as follows:
A director of a company must act in the way he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of
the company for the benefit of its members as a whole, and in doing so have regard (amongst other matters) to:
•
the likely consequences of any decision in the long term,
•
•
•
the interests of the company's employees,
the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others,
the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment,
the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and
the need to act fairly as between members of the company.
•
The longevity of employment for members of staff and internal promotion is a key policy of the business as proven by the
fact that at 31st January 2021, two thirds of the senior management team had joined at entry level working on the shop
floor.
The company has ensured that the staff are trained to a level, which provides excellent service to customers and guests.
The ambition of long term relationships continues throughout all aspects of the business. Whilst this is an obvious
statement for the relationship with customers, it is also true for suppliers and sub contractors. The House of Bruar is very
proud of the fact that several suppliers have been with the company since the inception 25 years ago.
During the lockdown the food hall remained open to provide a service to the local community.
With the development of electric vehicles, there are plans to create a charging hub at Bruar, which will incorporate
chargers of various speeds. Investigations are underway to assess the viability of using power generated from a
neighbouring hydro electric scheme.

DIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2021

to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for

THE HOUSE OF BRUAR LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF BRUAR LIMITED
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of The House of Bruar Limited (the 'company') for the year ended 31 January
2021 which comprise the statement of comprehensive income, the balance sheet, the statement of changes in equity and
notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FR$ 102 The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).
•
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 January 2021 and of its profit for the year
then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAS (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in
the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a
period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a
material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

THE HOUSE OF BRUAR LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF BRUAR LIMITED
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit,
we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you
if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; cr
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the
company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations,
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAS (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
-8-
THE HOUSE OF BRUAR LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF BRUAR LIMITED
Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above and on the Financial Reporting Council's website, to detect material
misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.
We obtain and update our understanding of the entity, its activities, its control environment, and likely future
developments, including in relation to the legal and regulatory framework applicable and how the entity is complying with
that framework. Based on this understanding, we identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. This includes consideration of the risk
of acts by the entity that were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud.
In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, including fraud, we designed
procedures which included:
• Enquiry of management and those charged with governance around actual and potential litigation and claims as
well as actual, suspected and alleged fraud;
• Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;
• Assessing the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations considered to have a direct material effect on the
financial statements or the operations of the company through enquiry and inspection;
• Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with
applicable laws and regulations;
Performing audit work over the risk of management bias and override of controls, including testing of journal
entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, evaluating the business rationale of significant transactions
outside the normal course of business and reviewing accounting estimates for indicators of potential bias.
•
Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those
leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the
more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members, as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

THE HOUSE OF BRUAR LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2021
1
Accounting policies
Company information
The House of Bruar Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in Scotland. The registered office
is The House of Bruar, Blair Atholl, Perth, Perthshire, PH18 5TW.
1.1
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 ""The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland"" (""FRS 102"") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary a
mounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the holding
of previously revalued freehold property at deemed cost. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out
below.
This company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, being a member of a group where the parent of
that group prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements, including this company, which are
intended to give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group. The
company has therefore taken advantage of exemptions from the following disclosure requirements:
• Section 4 'Statement of Financial Position' Reconciliation of the opening and closing number of shares;
Section 7 'Statement of Cash Flows' - Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and
•
disclosures;
• Section 11 'Basic Financial Instruments' and Section 12 'Other Financial Instrument Issues' - Carrying
amounts, interest income/expense and net gains/losses for each category of financial instrument; basis of
determining fair values; details of collateral, loan defaults or breaches, details of hedges, hedging fair value
changes recognised in profit or loss and in other comprehensive income;
• Section 26 'Share based Payment' - Share-based payment expense charged to profit or loss, reconciliation
of opening and closing number and weighted average exercise price of share options, how the fair value of
options granted was measured, measurement and carrying amount of liabilities for cash-settled share-based
payments, explanation of modifications to arrangements;
Section 33 'Related Party Disclosures' Compensation for key management personnel.
The financial statements of the company are consolidated in the financial statements of Mark Birkbeck & Sons
Limited. These consolidated financial statements are available from its registered office, The House of Bruar, Blair
Atholl, Perth, Perthshire, PH18 5TW.
1.2
Going concern
At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. In making their assessment
the directors have considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus the directors continue to adopt the

1.3
Turnover
Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided
in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of
consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.
When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the consideration is the
present value of the future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the nominal
amount received is recognised as interest income.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
have passed to the buyer (usually on dispatch of the goods), the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is
probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the costs incurred or
to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
1.4
Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at
cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired on business combinations are recognised separately from goodwill at the acquisition
date where it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the
entity and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably; the intangible asset arises from contractual or other
legal rights; and the intangible asset is separable from the entity.
Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:
Other intangible assets
5% to 33% straight line
1.5
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:
Freehold land and buildings
2% straight line
over the term of the lease
Leasehold improvements
Fixtures and fittings
Computers
Motor vehicles
15% straight line
33% straight line
25% straight line
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and
the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.
Freehold land
not depreciated.

1.6
Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the
company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case
the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to
apply. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit)
is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not
exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the
asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or
loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is
treated as a revaluation increase.
1.7
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost comprises
direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing
the stocks to their present location and condition.
Stocks held for distribution at no or nominal consideration are measured at the lower of cost and replacement cost,
adjusted where applicable for any loss of service potential.
Cost is based on the cost of purchase on a weighted average basis.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks over
its estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or loss.
Reversals of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.
1.8
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand deposits held at call with banks,
other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

1.9
Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 'Basic Financial Instruments and Section 12 'Other
Financial Instruments Issues' of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is
a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Basic financial assets
Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction
price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method
unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value
of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one
year are not amortised.
Other financial assets
Other financial assets, including investments in equity instruments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint
ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price. Such assets are subsequently
carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, except that investments in equity
instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost
less impairment.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of
impairment at each reporting end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected. If an
asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the
estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in
profit or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised,
the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the
carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is
recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are
settled, or when the company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has
transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.
Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of
the company after deducting all of its liabilities.

Accounting policies

Basic financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and preference shares
that are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a
financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments
discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction price
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Other financial liabilities
Derivatives, including interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, are not basic financial
instruments. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and
are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in profit or
loss in finance costs or finance income as appropriate, unless hedge accounting is applied and the hedge is a cash
flow hedge.
Debt instruments that do not meet the conditions in FRS 102 paragraph 11.9 are subsequently measured at fair
value through profit or loss. Debt instruments may be designated as being measured at fair value through profit or
loss to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch or if the instruments are measured and their performance
evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company's contractual obligations expire or are discharged or
cancelled.
1.10 Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of
the company.
1.11 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in
the profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future
taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from
the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the
accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities
and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.
1.12 Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are
received.
Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to
terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.
1.13 Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
1.14 Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the
leased asset and recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
1.15 Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable
assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.
A grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised in income when the performance conditions are met.
Where a grant does not specify performance conditions it is recognised in income when the proceeds are received
or receivable. A grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability.
1.16 Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates
of the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on translation
in the period are included in profit or loss.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the
period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities are as follows.
Depreciation
The annual depreciation charge for tangible assets is sensitive to changes in the estimated useful economic lives
and residual values of the assets. The useful economic lives and residual values are assessed annually.
Stock
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. The company
estimates the net realisable value of stock based on an assessment of expected retail prices and the ageing of
stock. Stock is reviewed on a regular basis and the company will make provisions or allowances for excess or
obsolete stock and write down stock to net realisable value when deemed necessary. Stock of £6,943,205 (2020:
£8,221,740) is stated after a provision of £174,925 (2020: £114,925).

Financial risk management
pjectives and policies
The company holds or issues financial instruments in order to achieve three main objectives, being:
(a) to finance its operations;
(b) to manage its exposure to interest and currency risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance;
and
(c) for trading purposes.
In addition, various financial instruments (e.g. trade debtors, trade creditors, accruals and prepayments) arise
directly from the company's operations.
Transactions in financial instruments result in the company assuming or transferring to another party one or more of
the financial risks described below.
Credit risk
The company has no significant concentrations of credit risk. Amounts shown in the balance sheet best represent
the maximum credit risk exposure in the event other parties fail to perform their obligations under financial

Events after the reporting date
Since the year end, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to impact many local economies around the globe and
in common with many other UK businesses the company's operations have been affected. The Company operates
within a sector where measures taken based upon Government advice to contain the spread of the virus, including
travel bans, quarantines, and social distancing mean that operations have been affected during each period of
lockdown. The company has cut costs and taken advantage of available incentives to manage the financial impact
of the pandemic.
The Company has determined that these ongoing events are non-adjusting subsequent events. Accordingly, the
financial position and results of operations as of and for the period ended 31 January 2021 have not been adjusted
to reflect their impact.

GROUP STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021
Introduction
The Director presents his Strategic Report for the year ended 31 December 2021.
Business review and strategy
New Sales
New vehicle car sales volumes were heavily impacted by a global shortage of semi-conductors (computer chips) across the whole
range of both Volkswagen passenger car and commercial vehicle product. Whilst this led to extended lead times, margins improved
significantly in what was a supply/demand market.
Q1 2021 saw showroom closures due to COVID-19 restrictions, this saw improvements to the digital selling model that was
implemented during the re-opening of the businesses after the first lockdown of 2020. Whilst a frustration, this style of retailing led to a
further improved transactional quality through both unit and F+I profitability.
Used Sales
Due to supply shortages in new vehicles, used sales were an area of significant improvement during 2021 with all sites outperforming
their individual budgets. Across the market, used vehicle values showed consistent improvement throughout the year which posed
some challenges with re-stocking to match a strong rate of sale. This was managed through the use of market intelligence, effective
stock profiling and a dynamic pricing strategy to ensure a maximised profit opportunity.
Future Developments
New Suzuki franchise will be opening in Q1 2022 after an extensive refurbishment. This diversifies the Breeze group and we continue
to look to grow the business where the management team identifies a strategic fit.
Electrification continues to be an area of exceptional growth across the Volkswagen passenger car franchise. This model line-up is to
be joined by the ID5, the 3rd model in the ID family due in spring 2022. Built on the same MEB platform, the commercial franchise will
see the launch of the eagerly anticipated ID Buzz in both cargo and passenger carrying derivatives during late 2022. This is an
exceptionally important product along with the new Multi-Van as a Caravelle replacement.
Coronavirus
The Breeze Management Team continue to react to government guidelines regarding COVID-19, there is an ongoing focus to ensure
the businesses are correctly resourced in line with showroom closures and subsequent pent-up demand for those wishing for a
physical transaction upon re-opening.

BREEZE MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED
GROUP STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021
Principal risks and uncertainties
The management of the business and the nature of the Group's strategy are subject to a number of risks. The main risks arising are
manufacturer product, competition, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Director reviews and agrees policies for managing
each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Director is of the opinion that a thorough risk management process is adopted which involves the formal review of all the risks
identified below. Where possible, processes are in place to monitor and mitigate such risks.
Manufacturer product
We are reliant on our new vehicle product from Volkswagen which continues to be strong, despite a lack of physical supply. Whilst we
are exposed to risks, we believe that the new product in future years from Volkswagen will be of a continued high quality. We mitigate
this risk by focusing on our other core business areas including vehicle sales, parts sales and service sales.
Competition
The motor retail market in which the group operates is highly competitive. As a result there is constant downwards pressure on margins
and the additional risk of being unable to meet customer's expectations. Policies of transparency in negotiations, constant price
monitoring and continuing to focus on our high level of service are in place to mitigate such risks.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and the cash at bank. The Group's exposure to interest rate
fluctuations on its borrowings is managed by the use of effective working capital management keeping borrowings within the agreed
facilities limit.
The interest rate exposure of the financial assets and liability of the Group as at 31 December 2021 is shown in the balance sheet. The
Group policy throughout the year has been to achieve an effective working capital management through the day to day involvement of
management in business decisions.
Credit risk
The Group's principal financial assets are freehold property, stock, cash and trade debtors. The credit risk associated with cash is
limited as the counter parties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The principal credit risk arises
therefore from its trade debtors.
In order to manage credit risk the Director sets limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and third party credit
references. Credit limits are reviewed by the credit controller on a regular basis in conjunction with debt ageing and collection history.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash
assets safely and profitability. The Group policy throughout the year has been to achieve this objective through the day to day
involvement of management in business decisions rather than through setting maximum or minimum liquidity ratios. Short term
flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities. The Group is encompassed in the Group facility.

BREEZE MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED
GROUP STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021
BREXIT
New trading arrangements between the United Kingdom and the European Union took effect on 31 December 2020. In general, tariffs
and quotas on trade have not been introduced, although administrative complications and regulatory restrictions have reduced the
freedom of cross-border trade. The effect on the Group has been minimised due to the Volkswagen Group UK importing the vehicles
into the UK for the network. The business is continually monitoring the supply chain to understand any delays due to BREXIT and the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Financial key performance indicators
The Director has monitored the progress of the overall Group strategy and the individual strategic elements by reference to certain
financial and non-financial key performance indicators.
2021 2020
Gross profit margin % 8.9 6.9 The ratio of gross profit to sales.

Energy and emissions reporting
This section includes our mandatory reporting of energy and greenhouse gas emissions for the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December
2021, pursuant to the Companies (Directors' Report) and Limited Liability Partnerships (Energy and Carbon Report) Regulations 2018,
implementing the government's Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) policy.
Our methodology to calculate our greenhouse gas emissions is based on the 'Environmental Reporting Guidelines: Including
streamlined energy and carbon reporting guidance (March 2019)' issued by DEFRA, using DEFRA's 2020 and 2021 conversion factors
as appropriate. In some cases, consumption has been extrapolated from available data or direct comparison made to a comparable
period.
We report using a financial control approach to define our organisational boundary. We have reported all material emission sources
required by the regulations for which we deem ourselves to be responsible and have maintained records of all source data and
calculations.
During the reporting period, no energy efficiency actions have been taken. The table below includes total energy consumption
(reported as kWh) and greenhouse gas emissions for the sources required by the regulations, along with our intensity ratio.

JE Corderoy
Director's responsibilities statement
The director is responsible for preparing the Group Strategic Report, the Director's Report and the consolidated financial statements in
accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Company laws require the director to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the director has elected to
prepare the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in
the UK and Republic of Ireland'. Under company law the director must not approve the financial statements unless he is satisfied that
they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, the director is required to:
select suitable accounting policies for the Group's financial statements and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in
business.
The director is responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group's transactions
and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable him to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. He is also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company
and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

BREEZE MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED
DIRECTOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going con basis. In considering going concern, management has reviewed the
financial information of the Group and the Company for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the accounts.
Having reviewed this information, management has a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis
in preparing the financial statements.
Breeze continue to have the support of our financial stakeholders Barclays Bank, Lombard and Volkswagen Bank for the overdraft
facility and stocking facility.
As at 31 December 2021 the Group reported a profit of £2,162,526 (2020: profit of £722,705) and a net asset position of £3,012,674
(2020: £1,110,148). The director has applied the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Qualifying third party indemnity provisions
The Director benefits from a qualifying third party indemnity provision in the form permitted by the Section 234 of the Companies Act
2006 in respect of certain third party actions against the Director. No claim or notice of claim in respect of these indemnities has been
received in the period. The qualifying indemnity provision was in force throughout the financial period and up to the date of approval of
the Director's Report.
Matters covered in the Group Strategic Report
As permitted by Paragraph 1A of Schedule 7 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group (Accounts and Reports)
Regulations 2008 certain matters which are required to be disclosed in the directors' report have been omitted as they are included in
the strategic report on pages 1 to 6. These matters relate to business review, future development and principal risks and uncertainties.
Provision of information to auditor
The director at the time when this Director's Report is approved has confirmed that:
so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company and the Group's auditor is unaware; and
he has taken all the steps that ought to have been taken as a director in order to be aware of any relevant audit information and
to establish that the Company and the Group's auditor is aware of that information.
Post balance sheet events
There have been no significant events affecting the Company and the Group since the year end.

BREEZE MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BREEZE MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Breeze Motor Company Limited (the 'Company') and its subsidiaries (the 'Group') for the
year ended 31 December 2021 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and
Company Statement of Financial Positions, the Consolidated and Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including FRS 102 ""The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland"" (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion, the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the Group and the Company's affairs as at 31 December 2021 and of the Group's profit
for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAS (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the Group and the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a
period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the director with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this
report.
Other Information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's
report thereon. The director is responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express
any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
-9-
BREEZE MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BREEZE MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED
Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with
the financial statements or our wledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a
material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a
material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Director's Report for the financial year for which the financial statements
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
the Strategic Report and the Director's Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we
have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Director's Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,
in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not
visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of director's remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
- 10-
BREEZE MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BREEZE MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED
Responsibilities of Director
As explained more fully in the Director's Responsibilities Statement set out on page 6, the director is responsible for the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the director
determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the director is responsible for assessing the Group and the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
director intends either to liquidate the Group and the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAS (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.
Based on our understanding of the Group and Company and its industry, we considered that non-compliance with the following laws
and regulations might have a material effect on the financial statements: pension legislation, employment regulation, health and safety
regulation, anti-money laundering regulation, non-compliance with implementation of government support schemes relating to
COVID-19, VW standards and WLTP.
To help us identify instances of non-compliance with these laws and regulations, and in identifying and assessing the risks of material
misstatement in respect to non-compliance, our procedures included, but were not limited to:
Inquiring of management and, where appropriate, those charged with governance, as to whether the Group and the Company is in
compliance with laws and regulations, and discussing their policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and
regulations;
Inspecting correspondence, if any, with relevant licensing or regulatory authorities;
Communicating identified laws and regulations to the engagement team and remaining alert to any indications of non-compliance
throughout our audit; and
Considering the risk of acts by the Group and the Company which were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including
fraud.
We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the preparation of the financial statements, such as tax
legislation, pension legislation, the Companies Act 2006.
- 11 -
BREEZE MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF BREEZE MOTOR COMPANY LIMITED
In addition, we evaluated the director's and management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial
statements, including the risk of management override of controls, and determined that the principal risks were related to posting
manual journal entries to manipulate financial performance, management bias through judgements and assumptions in significant
accounting estimates, in particular in relation to loss reserves, revenue recognition (which we pinpointed to the cut-off assertion, and
significant one-off or unusual transactions).
Our audit procedures in relation to fraud included but were not limited to:
Making enquiries of the directors and management on whether they had knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;
Gaining an understanding of the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud;
Discussing amongst the engagement team the risks of fraud; and
Addressing the risks of fraud through management override of controls by performing journal entry testing.
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of
irregularities including fraud rests with management. As with any audit, there remained a risk of non-detection of irregularities, as these
may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal controls.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's
website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
Use of the audit report
This report is made solely to the Company's members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them
in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Group and the Company and the Company's members as a body for our audit work, for this report, or for the
opinions we have formed.

Accounting policies
2.1
Basis of preparation of financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention unless otherwise specified within these
accounting policies and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102, the Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland and the Companies Act 2006.
The preparation of financial statements in compliance with FRS 102 requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires Group management to exercise judgement in applying the Group's accounting policies (see
note 3).
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not
presented its own Statement of Comprehensive Income in these financial statements.
The Company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102 and has elected to take the exemption under FRS 102,
para 1.12 (b) not to present the Company Statement of Cash Flows.
The financial statements are presented in Sterling (£).
The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
2.2 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its own subsidiaries (""the Group"") as if they
form a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.
2.3 Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In considering going concern, management has
reviewed the financial information of the Group and the Company for a period of at least 12 months from the date of
approval of the accounts. Having reviewed this information, management has a reasonable expectation that the Group
and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Breeze continue to have the support of our financial stakeholders at Barclays Bank, Lombard and Volkswagen Bank for
the overdraft facility and stocking facility. for the overdraft facility and stocking facility.
As at 31 December 2021 the Group reported a profit of £2,162,526 (2020: profit of £722,705) and a net asset position of £
3,012,674 (2020: £1,110,148). The director has applied the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

Accounting policies (continued)
2.4 Turnover
Turnover is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue
can be reliably measured. Turnover is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding
discounts, rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.
Sales of motor vehicles, parts and accessories are recognised on the earlier of full payment by, or delivery date to, the
customer together with the associated manufacturer vehicle bonus income. Any other manufacturer income in relation to
achieving targets is recognised on an accruals basis. Servicing revenue is recognised on the completion of the agreed
work.
Sale of goods
Turnover from the sale of goods is recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
• the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer;
ownership nor
• the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with
effective control over the goods sold;
* the amount of turnover can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the Group will receive the consideration due under the transaction; and
• the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
Rendering of services
Turnover from a contract to provide services is recognised in the period in which the services are provided in accordance
with the stage of completion of the contract when all of the following conditions are satisfied:
• the amount of turnover can be measured reliably;
• it is probable that the Group will receive the consideration due under the contract;
• the stage of completion of the contract at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably; and
• the costs incurred and the costs to complete the contract can be measured reliably.
2.5 Operating leases: the Group as lessee
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over
the lease term.
2.6 Leased assets: the Group as lessee
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets. Assets
acquired by nce lease are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and
lives. Assets acquired by
hire purchase are depreciated over their useful lives. Finance leases are those where substantially all of the benefits and
risks of ownership are assumed by the Company. Obligations under such agreements are included in creditors net of the
finance charge allocated to future periods. The finance element of the rental payment is charged to the Statement of
Comprehensive Income so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligation outstanding in each
period.

2.7
Government grants
Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102. Grants relating to expenditure on tangible fixed
assets are credited to profit or loss at the same rate as the depreciation on the assets to which the grant relates. The
deferred element of grants is included in creditors as deferred income.
Grants of a revenue nature are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the same period
as the related expenditure.
2.8 Interest receivable and similar income
Interest income is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income using the effective interest
method.
2.9
Interest payable and similar expenses
Finance costs are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the term of the debt using the
effective interest method so that the amount charged is at a constant rate on the carrying amount. Issue costs are initially
recognised as a reduction in the proceeds of the associated capital instrument.

2.10 Pensions
Defined contribution pension plan
The Group operates a defined contribution plan for its employees. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under
which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. Once the contributions have been paid the Group has no
further payment obligations.
The contributions are recognised as an expense in profit or loss when they fall due. Amounts not paid are shown in other
creditors as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position. The assets of the plan are held separately from the Group in
independently administered funds.
2.11 Current and deferred taxation
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income except that a charge attributable to an item of income and expense recognised as other
comprehensive income or to an item recognised directly in equity is also recognised in other comprehensive income or
directly in equity respectively.
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the Company and the Group operate and generate income.
Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the
reporting date, except that:
The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against
the reversal of deferred lax liabilities or other future laxable profits; and
Any deferred tax balances are reversed if and when all conditions for retaining associated tax allowances have
been met.
Deferred tax balances are not recognised in respect of permanent differences except in respect of business
combinations, when deferred tax is recognised on the differences between the fair values of assets acquired and the
future tax deductions available for them and the differences between the fair values of liabilities acquired and the amount
that will be assessed for tax. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021

Accounting policies (continued)
2.12 Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost. After recognition, under the cost model, intangible assets are measured
at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
At each reporting date the company assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is determined which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
All intangible assets are considered to have a finite useful life. If a reliable estimate of the useful life cannot be made, the
useful life shall not exceed ten years.
2.13 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets under the cost model are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any
accumulated impairment losses. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to
the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
At each reporting date the company assesses whether there is any indication of impairment. If such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is determined which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised where the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The Group adds to the carrying amount of an item of fixed assets the cost of replacing part of such an item when that cost
is incurred, if the replacement part is expected to provide incremental future benefits to the Group. The carrying amount of
the replaced part is derecognised. Repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the period in which they
are incurred.
Depreciation is charged so as to allocate the cost of assets less their residual value over their estimated useful lives,
using the straight-line method.
Depreciation is provided on the following basis:
Freehold property
Long-term leasehold property
Plant and machinery
Fixtures and fittings
Computer equipment
Assets in the course of construction
-2.5% straight line on buildings
- Over the period of the lease
-20% straight line
-20% straight line
-33% straight line
- Not depreciated
The assets' residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted prospectively if
appropriate, or if there is an indication of a significant change since the last reporting date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Accounting policies (continued)
2.14 Revaluation of tangible fixed assets
Individual freehold properties are carried at current year value at fair value at the date of the revaluation less any
subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses. Revaluations are undertaken
with sufficient regularity to ensure the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined
using fair value at the Statement of Financial Position date.
Fair values are determined from market based evidence normally undertaken by professionally qualified valuers.
Revaluation gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income unless losses exceed the previously
recognised gains or reflect a clear consumption of economic benefits, in which case the excess losses are recognised in
the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
2.15 Investment property
Investment property is carried at fair value determined annually by external valuers and derived from the current market
rents and investment property yields for comparable real estate, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature,
location or condition of the specific asset. No depreciation is provided. Changes in fair value are recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
2.16 Valuation of investments
Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
2.17 Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less costs to complete
and sell. Cost is based on the cost of purchase on a first in, first out basis. Work in progress and finished goods include
labour and attributable overheads.
At each reporting date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stock is impaired, the carrying amount is reduced to its
selling price less costs to complete and sell. The impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Liabilities relating to stocking loan liabilities are included in trade creditors on the Statement of Financial Position.
Stock provisions are made by management based on age and condition of stock and related costs using their knowledge
of the business and prevailing market conditions.
Consignment stock is valued at prices set by manufacture. Management controls the ageing profile of the consignment
stock and is reviewed frequently.

2.18 New Vehicle funding
Consignment vehicles on which the company bears the risk and responsibilities of ownership are regarded as being
under the control of the company and, in accordance with Section 13 of FRS 102, are included in inventory on the
Statement of Financial Position, although legal title has not passed to the company. The corresponding liability is included
as new vehicle funding and is secured directly on these vehicles.
2.19 Debtors: Amounts falling due within one year
Short-term debtors are measured at transaction price, less any impairment. Loans receivable are measured initially at fair
value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less
any impairment.
2.20 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash is represented by cash in hand and deposits with financial institutions repayable without penalty on notice of not
more than 24 hours. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments that mature in no more than three months from the
date of acquisition and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.
In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts that are
repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management.
2.21 Creditors
Short-term creditors are measured at the transaction price. Other financial liabilities, including bank loans, are measured
initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective
interest method.

2.22 Provisions for liabilities
Provisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the Group a legal or constructive obligation that probably
requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.
Provisions are charged as an expense to profit or loss in the year that the Group becomes aware of the obligation, and
are measured at the best estimate at the reporting date of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, taking into
account relevant risks and uncertainties.
When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the Statement of Financial Position.
2.23 Financial instruments
The Group only enters into basic financial instrument transactions that result in the recognition of financial assets and
liabilities like trade and other debtors and creditors, loans from banks and other third parties, loans to related parties and
investments in ordinary shares.
Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period for
objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is recognised in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an asset's
carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. If
a financial asset has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effective
interest rate determined under the contract.
For financial assets measured at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between an
asset's carrying amount and best estimate of the recoverable amount, which is an approximation of the amount that the
Group would receive for the asset if it were to be sold at the reporting date.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Statement of Financial Position when there is
an enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the
asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
2.24 Dividends
Equity dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. Interim equity dividends are recognised when paid.
Final equity dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.

Judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The prepa tion of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities. Future events and their affects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore the
determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement based on various assumptions and other factors such as
historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, and in some circumstances, actuarial techniques. The Group
constantly re-evaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate.
3.1 Critical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies
(i) Deferred Tax
Deferred lax liabilities are always provided in full. Deferred lax assels are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the
underlying deductable temporary difference will be able to be offset against future taxable income. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation,
provided they are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is recognised as a component of
the tax expense in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged to other comprehensive income or directly to
equity.
(ii) Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets, are depreciated over their useful lives taking into account residual values, where appropriate. The actual
lives of the assets and residual values are assessed annually and may vary depending on the number of factors. In
re-assessing asset lives, factors such as technological innovation, product life cycles and maintenance programmes are taken
into account. Residual value assessments consider issues such as future market conditions, the remaining life of the asset and
projected disposal values.
(iii) Investments
The carrying value of investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost less impairment. This is considered at each balance
sheet date, based upon market value.
3.2 Key sources of estimation uncertainty
(i) Inventories
In determining the net realisable value of inventories, management consider approaches based on type of inventory.
Demonstrator stock is held at cost less provision in line with NRV for the end of the term of demonstrator. Used vehicle stock is
continuously monitored against market conditions based on industry leading valuation estimates. Parts stock is reviewed for
obsolescence periodically.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2021
The directors present their strategic report for the year ended 31 July 2021.
BUSINESS REVIEW
The statement of comprehensive income is set out on page 13 and shows a profit before tax of £6,265,365 for the period.
Turnover for the period amounted to £77,623,053.
The company continues to increase its sales & profitability, with another strong performance this year.
The company's core strategy delivers growth through increased sales and performance, plus expansion of outlets. The
company operates a mix of freehold and leasehold properties, providing a strong framework for expansion.
During the period, the company opened three more sites in Shipley, Stratford Upon Avon and Boston, taking the total
number of sites to 123. The company expects to open 12 sites in the next financial year.
The company is also open to acquisition opportunities in addition to individual openings.
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The management of the business and execution of the company's strategy are subject to a number of risks. The principal
risks and uncertainties affecting the company are considered to relate to competition from both national and independent
retailers, employee retention, product availability and cost inflation.
Competition remains fierce, which ultimately benefits the customer through lower pricing and reduced
margins. Increasing the company's market share through expansion and customer retention enables the company to
continue to grow.
Employee retention is a key focus of the company and has been a challenge during the past year, as it has been for
many companies across different industries. Discussion with employees on all levels occurs frequently, through meetings
and literature. The development and growth of social media has allowed us to target a greater mix of the company's
employee base, bringing people's skills and achievements to everyone's attention, publicising local events and issues
and praising jobs well done. Decisions on public holiday opening, opening hours and rewards for length of service have
been made based on discussions with staff members. Recognition of skills continues, with assistance towards further
education and qualifications being offered. Since having obtained industry standard training recognition, the company
has sponsored many applicants to the government-controlled MOT authorised examiner status. This qualification brings
with it career growth, employee financial reward and greater skills knowledge. This year the company has pro-actively
increased the number of people gaining the MOT qualification. The company has also taken on a number apprentices
at the start of the new financial year and expects to be able continue to do this in future years.
To mitigate the risk of product availability, the company has increased the number of authorised suppliers to enable a
wider range of products to be made available to the company's customers. This has resulted in multiple suppliers for
similar products, to ensure that the mix of products meet the company's customers demands. Each supplier is important
to the company for providing effective, timely and accurate product supply to the local centre.
The company works hard to ensure timely delivery to our sites to meet customer demand and have increased the
number of same day options for its online customers.
Cost inflation has increased during the period and also since the period end. To mitigate the impact, the company has
embarked on a programme to become more energy efficient, both reducing costs and improving its impact on the
environment.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2021
SECTION 172(1) STATEMENT
Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires a director of a company to act in the way he or she considers, in good
faith, would most likely promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. In this respect the
Directors have had regard, amongst other matters, to the:
-
-
- Likely consequences of any decisions in the long-term;
Interests the Company's employees;
Need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others;
- Impact of the Company's operations on the community and environment;
- Desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct;
and
Need to act fairly as between members of the Company.
-
The Directors seek to ensure that their decision making process not only takes into account the Company's purpose,
vision and values, together with its strategic priorities, but also reflects, as far as practical and possible, the interests of all
stakeholders.
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
The company manages the business by reference to key performance indicators. Each trading outlet is recognised as a
profit centre and is measured accordingly. Due to the varied nature of the business, the performance indicators will differ
greatly from outlet to outlet, therefore individual monitoring is paramount and is measured daily.
Competent management reporting tools are in place to provide essential current, timely reporting in a clear and precise
manner.
Principal indicators used by the company include, but are not limited to;
(1) Revenue recognized as per the financial statements
(2) Gross margin = gross profit/gross sales
(3) Wages sales percentage = staff costs/gross sales

FORMULA ONE AUTO CENTRES LIMITED (REGISTERED NUMBER: 01437311)
STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2021
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The company's operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of price risk, credit risk, liquidity
risk and interest rate cash flow risk. The company has in place policies and procedures that seek to limit the potentially
adverse effects on the financial performance of the company of such risks. These policies are set by the directors.
The company does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks.
Price risk
Due to the market the company operates in, the company is exposed to price risk from its suppliers and competitors.
However, given the size of the company's operations and in addition to the actions identified above, the company is able
to manage the potential exposure through supplier agreements and rebate mechanisms.
Credit risk
The majority of the company's sales are not made on credit. However, for those sales made on credit, appropriate credit
checks on customers who apply for credit accounts are made prior to the sale. The amount of any individual customer is
subject to a limit and the exposure of the company as a whole is mitigated by multiple credit control procedures and the
diverse nature of the customer base.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial
liabilities. The risk is mitigated as the company has sufficient cash resources available to it through either its own funds or
access to further bank facilities.
Brexit
The company continues to monitor the impact of Brexit and as shown in note 4 the company derives all of its income
from within the UK, and primarily purchases from UK suppliers. Where suppliers bring goods into the UK, the company
has discussed with their supplier their stock holding levels & continuity of supply such that the company anticipates that
there will be no significant disruption to the supply chain. Additionally, the group is able to source products from different
suppliers and is also not dependent on any one brand of product.
The company also has a low proportion of staff from EU countries and, therefore, considers that the likelihood of being
unable to find replacement staff as very low.
Covid-19
The company has managed to remain open & trade throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and is classed as an ""essential
service"" by the UK Government. Following the government's decision to extend MOT expiry dates during the first
lockdown, the shape of the company's turnover has shifted somewhat from April, May and June into August, September
and October. The company did furlough a small number of employees during quieter periods of trade in the period as
lockdowns and the changed MOT phasing impacted. However, the company feel that across the full year, trade has
continued to grow above pre-Covid levels.
The company received a substantial CLBILS Government-backed loan during the period to protect against a potential
further decline in business. This was repaid in full before the period end.
Interest rate cash flow risk
The company had both interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities during the year. Interest bearing assets
include cash balances which earn interest as floating rates. Interest bearing liabilities include debt facilities and loans
from the company's bankers which accrue interest at floating rates of interest.
At the end of the period, the company renewed and extended its revolving credit facility with the bank to support the
expansion plans.

sites to be purchased and opened. Taking the total sites to 135.

Energy Efficiency Action
The company has recently taken several steps to increase the businesses' energy efficiency across its chain of
autocentres, head office and in terms of the fleet.
With regards fleet, we have invested in one electric vehicle to date, trialling it's effectiveness for day to day operations. All
vehicles purchased are regularly serviced to minimise emissions.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JULY 2021
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Report of the Directors and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), including Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland'. Under company law the directors must not
approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are
required to:
-
-
-
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
-
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.
STATEMENT AS TO DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
So far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418 of the Companies Act
2006) of which the company's auditors are unaware, and each director has taken all the steps that he or she ought to
have taken as a director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that
the company's auditors are aware of that information.
AUDITORS
The auditors, Watson Associates (Audit Services) Ltd, will be proposed for re-appointment at the forthcoming Annual
General Meeting.

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF
FORMULA ONE AUTO CENTRES LIMITED
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Formula One Auto Centres Limited (the 'company') for the year ended 31
July 2021 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheet, Statement of Changes in Equity,
Cash Flow Statement and Notes to the Cash Flow Statement, Notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary of
significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
-
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 July 2021 and of its profit for the year then
ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
-
-
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that
are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled
our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in
the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a
period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information in the Strategic
Report and the Report of the Directors, but does not include the financial statements and our Report of the Auditors
thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent
material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial
statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of
this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
-
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
the information given in the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
the Strategic Report and the Report of the Directors have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF
FORMULA ONE AUTO CENTRES LIMITED
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit,
we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or the Report of the Directors.
-
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you
if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities set out on page eight, the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the directors determine necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Page 10
REPORT OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS TO THE MEMBERS OF
FORMULA ONE AUTO CENTRES LIMITED
Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a Report of the Auditors that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAS (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:
Based on our understanding of the Company and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with
laws and regulations related to employment laws and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a
material effect on the financial statements.
We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements
such as the Companies Act 2006. We evaluated management's incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation
of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related
to posting inappropriate journal entries to achieve desired financial results and the manipulation of exceptional items and
management bias in accounting estimates.
Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included:
- enquiries with management, including consideration of known or suspected instances of fraud and non-compliance with
laws and regulations and examining supporting calculations where a provision has been made in respect of these;
- reading key correspondence with regulatory authorities in relation to compliance with certain employment laws;
- understanding and evaluating the design and implementation of management's controls designed to prevent and detect
irregularities;
- challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates, in particular in
relation to valuation of investment property, impairment of investments in subsidiaries and the measurement and
classification of exceptional items;
- identifying and testing journal entries, in particular any journal entries posted with unusual account combinations and
postings by unusual users.
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws
and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become
aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional
misrepresentations, or through collusion.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting
Council's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our Report of the Auditors.

STATUTORY INFORMATION
Formula One Auto Centres Limited is a private company, limited by shares, registered in England and Wales.
The company's registered number and registered office address can be found on the Company Information page.
2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparing the financial statements
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 ""The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland"" and the Companies Act 2006. The
financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of
certain assets.
Turnover
Turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates,
value added tax and other sales taxes.
Goodwill
Goodwill, being the amounts paid in connection with the acquisition of a couple of businesses, is being amortised
evenly over their individual estimated useful life of 10 years.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are initially measured at cost. After initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost
less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Computer software is being amortised evenly over its estimated useful life of four years.
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided at the following annual rates in order to write off each asset over its
estimated useful life or, if held under a finance lease, over the lease term, whichever is the shorter.
Freehold Property - Held at cost from 01/08/19 (Previously 2% on cost)
Long Leasehold - in accordance with the property
Plant and Machinery - straight line over 6 years (Previously 25% on cost)
Motor Vehicles -25% on cost
Revaluation of tangible fixed assets
Individual freehold and leasehold properties were carried at fair value on transition to FR$ 102 less any
subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated losses. Revaluations were undertaken with
sufficient regularity to ensure the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined
using fair value at the balance sheet date.
Fair values were determined from market-based evidence normally undertaken by professionally qualified valuers.
Revaluation gains and losses are recognised in the Statement of comprehensive income unless losses exceed
the previously recognised gains or reflect a clear consumption of economic benefits, in which case the excess
losses are recognised in profit or loss.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
Government grants
Grants are accounted under the accruals model as permitted by FRS 102. Grants relating to expenditure on
tangible fixed assets are credited to the profit and loss account at the same rate as the depreciation on the assets
to which the grant relates. The deferred element of grants is included in creditors as deferred income.
Grants of a revenue nature are recognised in ""other income"" within profit or loss in the same period as the related
expenditure.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment in the individual financial statements.
Investment property
Investment property is shown at most recent valuation. Any aggregate surplus or deficit arising from changes in
fair value is recognised in profit or loss.
Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or capital appreciation. Investment properties are
initially measured at cost including transaction costs. Subsequently, investment properties whose fair value can
be measured reliably without undue cost or effort on an on-going basis are measured at fair value. Gains and
losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are included in profit or loss in the period in
which they arise.
Investment properties whose fair value cannot be measured reliably without undue cost or effort on an on-going
basis are included in plant, property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated
impairment losses.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, being the estimated selling price less costs to
disposal, after making due allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. Last cost is used to approximate cost.
At each balance sheet date, stocks are assessed for impairment. If stock is impaired, the carrying amount is
reduced to its selling price less costs to disposal. The impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss,
in the Statement of comprehensive income.
Financial instruments
The company only enters into basic financial instruments transactions that result in the recognition of financial
assets and liabilities like trade and other accounts receivable and payable, loans from banks and other third
parties, and loans to related parties.
Debt instruments that are payable or receivable within one year, are measured, initially and subsequently, at the
undiscounted amount of the cash or other consideration expected to be paid or received; other debt instruments
are initially measured at present value of the future payments and subsequently at amortised cost using the
effective interest method.
Financial assets that are measured at cost and amortised cost are assessed at the end of each reporting period
for objective evidence of impairment. If objective evidence of impairment is found, an impairment loss is
recognised in profit or loss.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet only when there is an
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

Taxation
Taxation for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in
equity.
Current or def
ed taxation assets and liabilities are not
scounted.
Current tax is recognised at the amount of tax payable using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance
sheet date.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenses in tax assessments in periods different from
those in which they are recognised in financial statements. Deferred tax is measured using tax rates and laws that
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the year end and that are expected to apply to the reversal of the
timing difference.
Unrelieved tax losses and other deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that they
will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits.
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance
sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date
of transaction. Exchange differences are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
Hire purchase and leasing commitments
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts or finance leases are capitalised in the balance sheet. Those held
under hire purchase contracts are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Those held under finance leases
are depreciated over their estimated useful lives or the lease term, whichever is the shorter.
The interest element of these obligations is charged to profit or loss over the relevant period. The capital element
of the future payments is treated as a liability.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the period of the
lease.
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits
The company operates a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions payable to the company's pension
scheme are charged to profit or loss in the period to which they relate.
3.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
No significant judgements have had to be made by management in preparing these financial statements.
There were no key assumptions made concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at
the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities within the next financial year.

TURNOVER
Turnover comprises revenue recognised by the company in respect of goods and services supplied during the
year, excluding VAT and trade discounts. Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership
transfer which is typically when the service is completed, or the goods provided.
Property rental income is recognised by the company on an accrual basis, spread over the life of the lease
arrangement.

Directors' Report for the Period from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2021
The directors present their report and the for the period from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2021.
Directors of the company
The directors who held office during the period were as follows:
A Hindmarch
A Adams
S Hindmarch
Section 172 statement
The Directors believe that they have effectively implemented their duties under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. The
company has considered the long-term strategy of the business in the Strategic Report and consider that this strategy will
continue to deliver long term success to the business and it's stakeholders.
The company is committed to maintaining an excellent reputation and strives to achieve high standards. We are highly selective
about which suppliers are used to deliver best value while maintaining an awareness of the environmental impact of the work
that they do and strive to reduce their carbon footprint.
The Directors recognise the importance of wider stakeholders in delivering their strategy and achieving sustainability within the
business. The main stakeholders in the company are considered to be the employees, suppliers and customers.
In ensuring that all our stakeholders are considered as part of every decision process we believe we act fairly between all
members of the company.
Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting
Commercial is committed to maintaining its reputation for excellence and strives towards achieving the highest possible ethical
and environmental standards. Since 2006, Commercial has been reporting its carbon footprint across all our company sites,
which now include London, Leeds and Cheltenham. Commercial also remains a Carbon Neutral company since 2006. We offset
our total emissions, including Scope 3 emissions, through the purchase of VCS offset credits with Natural Capital Partners. We
exclusively support carbon sequestration projects that are independently verified to the highest standard. Information on a
recent offset project can be found here: https://www.naturalcapitalpartners.com/projects/project/mexican-forestry.
Each year, our carbon emissions data are independently audited and verified by a third party, The Planet Mark. All of our
environmental practices and procedures are subject to an annual independent assurance review with British Standards
Institution (ISO14001). Our carbon reporting period falls within 12 months of the 17 month reporting period. Commercial will be
benchmarking against our Net-Zero base year, 2018, alongside our previous year's emissions. Moving forward we will compare
each year alongside our 2018 base year.
Our energy use and emissions data for the reporting period are as follows:

COMMERCIAL CORPORATE SERVICES LIMITED
Directors' Report for the Period from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2021
Commercial has calculated all emissions associated with our carbon footprint in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e)
across all 3 scopes. We use the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard because of its widely reputable reporting
standards. Commercial has calculated all kWh data using the relevant UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company
Reporting by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Standard and Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs
(2020) to understand our energy use across business activities within the reporting year.
In 2020/21, due to the pandemic, Commercial moved towards a hybrid/home working model. As a result, we have seen a
significant decrease emissions over the past reporting year. Furthermore, both our London and Cheltenham offices have over
400 solar photovoltaic systems installed, since 2012, to help reduce our grid dependency. Since 2006, all of the electricity used
to power our offices has been supplied through a verified renewable tariff. All our energy providers retain, on our behalf, the
Renewable Energy Guarantee of Origin for our market-based emissions. In the future, Commercial is aiming to eliminate all
emissions associated with our head office, alongside decommissioning our central gas heating system in London, and banning
all petrol and diesel vehicles.
In 2021 Commercial pledged its commitment to be Net-Zero by 2028. This commitment is in line with the Science Based Target
Initiative (SBTi) and aims to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Commitments developed by SBTi require
Commercial to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% before 2030 and to measure and
reduce our Scope 3 emissions. However, Commercial's internal ambition remains to be a Net-Zero business by 2028 and to
reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 100% and to measure and reduce our Scope 3 emissions by
50%. We have already made significant progress towards our target to be a Net-Zero business. Our total carbon intensity
(tCO2e/£m) across all three scopes has decreased by 90% since 2006, the year our sustainability journey started.
Commercial is also committed to engaging its customers, suppliers and employees on sustainability topics. Our internal Change
Champions programme allows staff to collaborate on sustainable business projects which will generate positive environmental
or social outcomes. Highlights include the creation of a living wall, bike shed, park & stride and more. To find out more about
Commercial's sustainability journey, including our Social Impact Report, Change Champions Programme, Smart Technology
offerings and Social Enterprise, please visit our website https://commercial.co.uk/.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
Each director has taken the steps that they ought to have taken as a director in order to make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the company's auditor is aware of that information. The directors confirm that there is no
relevant information that they know of and of which they know the auditor is unaware.
Reappointment of auditors
The auditors have expressed their willingness to remain in office.

COMMERCIAL CORPORATE SERVICES LIMITED
Strategic Report for the period from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2021
The directors present their strategic report for the period from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2021.
Principal activity
The principal activity of the company is the provision of veterinary services.
Fair review of the business
The board of Commercial Corporate Services are pleased to present our accounts to the 17 months to 30 June 2021.
The Directors are pleased with the strong sales performance of Commercial despite the severe trading restrictions from COVID.
We have seen both sales growth and a good Net Profit which has been achieved from several new account wins and
introducing new product ranges. All our divisions have done well and we have also seen good growth in our two new divisions in
Technology products and Workwear.
We continue to invest heavily in our both our staff and systems in order to give the business the best possible platform to meet
our ambitious growth plans.
With Covid restrictions ending, we head into the new financial year in very good shape. We have a strong customer base, a
range of new products and a strong management team with clearly defined operational and strategic objectives. We are
genuinely excited about what we can achieve in 2022.
The directors consider the performance for the year and the financial position at the year end to be satisfactory.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The management of the group and the execution of the group's strategy are subject to a number of risks. The key business
risks and uncertainties affecting the group are considered to relate to competition from other providers of office supplies and IT
services and the challenges arising as a result of the current economic climate.
Key performance indicators
Given the nature of the business, the group's directors are of the opinion that key performance indicators are important. The
group uses a number of indicators to monitor and improve development, performance or the position of the business. Indicators
are reviewed and altered to meet changes both in the internal and external environments. The directors do not consider the
inclusion of an analysis using key performance indicators to be necessary to assist users of the financial statements in their
understanding of the financial performance or position of the group.
Objectives and policies
The group does not actively use financial instruments as part of its financial risk management. It is exposed to the usual credit
risk and cash flow risk associated with selling on credit and manages this through credit control procedures. The nature of its
financial instruments means that they are not subject to price or liquidity risk.
Going concern
In accordance with the Financial Reporting Council's 'Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for the Directors of UK
Companies 2009' the directors of all companies are now required to provide disclosures regarding the adoption of the going
concern basis of accounting.
The group has generated profits this financial period which has strengthened our cash position. The business manages its cash
carefully and has significant banking facilities available to it that remain unused.
The directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future and have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Approved by the Board on 28 March 2022 and signed on its behalf by:
S Hindmarch
Director
COMMERCIAL CORPORATE SERVICES LIMITED
Statement of Directors' Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, Directors' Report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have
elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or
loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
•
select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
*
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements; and
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the group's and
the company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and the
company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

COMMERCIAL CORPORATE SERVICES LIMITED
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Commercial Corporate Services Limited
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Commercial Corporate Services Limited (the parent company') and its subsidiaries
(the 'group') for the period from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2021, which comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account,
Consolidated Balance Sheet, Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Statement of Changes in Equity,
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and Notes to the Financial Statements, including a summary of significant accounting
policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of Ireland' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and the parent company's affairs as at 30 June 2021 and of the group's
profit for the period then ended;
•
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
•
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant
to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the director's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at
least twelve months from when the original financial statements were authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections
of this report.
Other information
The directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual
report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not
cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,
consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the
audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.

COMMERCIAL CORPORATE SERVICES LIMITED
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Commercial Corporate Services Limited
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
the information given in the Strategic Report and Directors' Report for the financial period for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
the Strategic Report and Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of our knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in
our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
•
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities set out on page 5, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as
the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to
continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no
realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAS (UK) will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements.
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which
our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:
•
Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that material misstatements in the financial statements
may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with the ISAS (UK).
In identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of fraud, including irregularities and non-compliance with
laws and regulations, our procedures included the following:
We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to the group and parent company financial
statements or that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the group and parent company. We determined that the most
significant laws and regulations included United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, UK Companies Act 2006
and taxation laws;
We understood how the group and parent company is complying with those legal and regulatory frameworks by making
enquiries of the management and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures.
• We assessed the susceptibility of the group's and parent company's financial statements to material misstatement, including
how fraud might occur. Audit procedures performed by the engagement team included:

COMMERCIAL CORPORATE SERVICES LIMITED
Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2021
1 General information
The company is a private company limited by share capital, incorporated in England and Wales.
The address of its registered office is:
Commercial House
Old Station Drive
Leckhampton
Cheltenham
GL53 ODL
2 Accounting policies
Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These policies have
been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Statement of compliance
These financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting
Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland'.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention except for, where disclosed in these
accounting policies, certain items that are shown at fair value.
The presentational currency of the financial statements is Pounds Sterling, being the functional currency of the primary
economic environment in which the company operates. Monetary amounts in these financial statements are rounded to the
nearest Pound.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings
drawn up to 30 June 2021.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the company. Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the
financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Profit and Loss Account from the effective
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the group.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for business combinations that result in the acquisition of subsidiaries by
the group. The cost of a business combination is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and
liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the business combination. Identifiable
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair
values at the acquisition date. Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirer's interest in the net fair
value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised is recorded as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between the company and its subsidiaries, which
are related parties, are eliminated in full.
Intra-group losses are also eliminated but may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial
statements.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the
group. Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the group's equity
therein. Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and
the non-controlling shareholder's share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.

COMMERCIAL CORPORATE SERVICES LIMITED
Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2021
Going concern
In assessing whether the going concern basis is appropriate, the directors take into account all available information about the
future, which is at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of signing these financial statements. The directors have
considered the impacts of Covid-19 on the financial statements and the future of the business.
The group has generated profits this financial period which has strengthened the cash position. The business manages its cash
carefully and has significant banking facilities available to it that remain unused.
The financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis, which the directors believe to be
appropriate.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the
revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
No key sources of estimation uncertainty have been identified by management in preparing these financial statements other
than those detailed in these accounting policies.
Revenue recognition
Turnover comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and provision of services in
the ordinary course of the group's activities. Turnover is shown net of sales/value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and
after eliminating sales within the company.
The group recognises revenue when: The amount of revenue can be reliably measured; it is probable that future economic
benefits will flow to the entity; and specific criteria have been met for each of the group's activities.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised based on the accrual model and are measured at the fair value of the asset received or
receivable. Grants are classified as relating either to revenue or to assets. Grants relating to revenue are recognised in income
over the period in which the related costs are recognised. Grants relating to assets are recognised over the expected useful life
of the asset. Where part of a grant relating to an asset is deferred, it is recognised as deferred income.
Foreign currency transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the respective functional currency of the
entity at the rates prevailing on the reporting period date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the initial transaction dates. Non-monetary items measured in
terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Tax
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the profit and loss account, except that
a charge attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is also recognised directly in
other comprehensive income.
The current corporation tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively
enacted by the reporting date in the countries where the group operates and generates taxable income.
- 16-
COMMERCIAL CORPORATE SERVICES LIMITED
Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2021
Deferred income tax is recognised on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and on unused tax losses or tax credits in the group. Deferred income
tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and a valuation allowance is set up against
deferred tax assets so that the net carrying amount equals the highest amount that is more likely than not to be recovered
based on current or future taxable profit.
Tangible assets
Tangible assets are stated in the statement of financial position at cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
The cost of tangible assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.
Depreciation
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and properties under construction over their
estimated useful lives, as follows:
Asset class
Depreciation method and rate
Short term leasehold property
20% straight line
Over the lower of the rental agreement or 3
Rental machines
years
Motor vehicle
Fixture and fittings
33% straight line
25% straight line
10% or 20% straight line
25% or 50% straight line
Print technology
Other fixed assets
Investment property
Investment property is carried at fair value, derived from the current market prices for comparable real estate determined
annually by external valuers. The valuers use observable market prices, adjusted if necessary for any difference in the nature,
location or condition of the specific asset. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the
aggregate of the fair values at acquisition date of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by
the group in exchange for control of the acquired, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination. When a
business combination agreement provides for an adjustment to the cost of the combination contingent on future events, the
group includes the estimated amount of that adjustment in the cost of the combination at the acquisition date if the adjustment is
probable and can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the group's interest in the
net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the entity recognised at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is held in the currency of the acquired entity and revalued to the closing rate at each
reporting period date.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised on the face of the balance sheet on the acquisition date and
subsequently the excess up the fair value of non-monetary assets acquired is recognised in profit or loss in the periods in
which the non-monetary assets are recovered.
Amortisation
Amortisation is provided on intangible assets so as to write off the cost, less any estimated residual value, over their useful life
as follows:
Asset class
Amortisation method and rate
Goodwill
Over 5 years

COMMERCIAL CORPORATE SERVICES LIMITED
Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2021
Investments
Investments in equity shares which are not publicly traded and where fair value cannot be measured reliably are measured at
cost less impairment.
Dividends on equity securities are recognised in income when receivable.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and call deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Trade debtors
Trade debtors are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.
Trade debtors are recognised initially at the transaction price. All trade debtors are repayable within one year and hence are
included at the undiscounted cost of cash expected to be received. A provision for the impairment of trade debtors is
established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original
terms of the debtors.
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost is determined using the
first-in, first-out method.
Trade creditors
Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from
suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if the group does not have an unconditional right, at the end of
the reporting period, to defor settlement of the creditor for at least twelve months after the reporting date. If there is an
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months after the reporting date, they are presented as non-current
liabilities.
Trade creditors are recognised initially at the transaction price and all are repayable within one year and hence are included at
the undiscounted amount of cash expected to be paid.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs. Interest-bearing borrowings are
subsequently carried at amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the amount due
on redemption being recognised as a charge to the Profit and Loss Account over the period of the relevant borrowing.
Interest expense is recognised on the basis of the effective interest method and is included in interest payable and similar
charges.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at
least twelve months after the reporting date.
Leases
Leases in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating
leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessee.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of their fair value at inception of the lease and the present value of
the minimum lease payments. These assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the
asset and the lease term. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Balance Sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance costs in the Profit and Loss Account and reduction of the lease obligation so
as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

COMMERCIAL CORPORATE SERVICES LIMITED
Notes to the Financial Statements for the Period from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2021
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Equity instruments are measured at the fair value of the cash or other resources
received or receivable, net of the direct costs of issuing the equity instruments. If payment is deferred and the time value of
money is material, the initial measurement is on a present value basis.
Dividends
Dividend distribution to the company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the reporting period
in which the dividends are declared.
Defined contribution pension obligation
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which fixed contributions are paid into a pension fund and the group has no
legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions even if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees
the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. If contribution
payments exceed the contribution due for service, the excess is recognised as a prepayment.
Financial instruments
Classification
Financial instruments are classified and accounted for according to the substance of the contractual arrangement, as financial
assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the
assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Where shares are issued, any component that creates a financial
liability of the company is presented as a liability on the balance sheet. The corresponding dividends relating to the liability
component are charged as interest expenses in the profit and loss account.
Recognition and measurement
All financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at transaction price (including transaction costs), except for those
financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value (which is normally the
transaction price excluding transaction costs), unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction. If an arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction, the financial asset or financial liability is measured at the present value of the future
payments discounted at a market rate of interest for a similar debt instrument.
Impairment
Assets, other than those measured at fair value, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. If there
is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss as described below.
A non financial asset is impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after
initial recognition, the estimated recoverable value of the asset has been reduced. The recoverable amount of an asset is the
higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of an impairment is the difference between the asset's carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.
For financial assets carried at cost less impairment, the impairment loss is the difference between the asset's carrying amount
and the best estimate of the amount that would be received for the asset if it were to be sold at the reporting date.
Where indicators exist for a decrease in impairment loss, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after
the impairment was recognised, the prior impairment loss is tested to determine reversal. An impairment loss is reversed on an
individual impaired financial asset to the extent that the revised recoverable value does not lead to a revised carrying amount
higher than the carrying value had no impairment been recognised.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021
The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 March 2021.
Fair review of the business
The group's principal activities continued to be those of the operation of home retail stores, the running of a hotel, leisure and golf
resort and a property development company. In February 2020 a group company, Vale of Glamorgan Hotel Limited, became the
majority shareholder in its subsidiary Bottlers and Distillers (Wales) Limited whose activities include the manufacture of spirits,
contract bottling and the operation of a visitor centre. In March 2021, the group became the sole shareholder in Bottlers and
Distillers (Wales) Limited.
The group's growth was significantly impacted by the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic from March 2020 onwards. Leckes
Retail were forced to close its stores for several periods in the year and were partially open or under restrictions during other times.
The Vale Resort was affected to an even greater degree with the Resort either closed or under restrictions for the vast majority of
the year. The Distillery company was also impacted by the closure of the ""on-trade"" pubs and restaurant businesses during
significant periods in the year and the delayed opening of its visitor centre.
The group's turnover of £50.6m in 2020/21 was £25.1m (33%) down on the previous year as a result of the impact of the closures
and significantly restricted trading activity brought about by the ment guidance and regulations. The board of directors
undertook measures to ensure that, despite the significant fall in trading revenues caused by the pandemic, the key strategic
objectives of the group were achieved as follows:
We maintained the high levels of customer service to our customers across our group operations whilst ensuring that we
complied with all government guidance and regulations;
We minimised the number of compulsory redundancies in the group thereby, protecting the employment of as many of our
loyal and valued employees as possible;
We complied with the financial covenants contained in our banking facility agreement thereby ensuring the continued
viability and development of the group and its subsidiary operations;
• We complied with the pre-existing credit terms agreed with our supplier base by paying all amounts due on time and in
full; and
We maintained the strong group balance sheet equity and liquidity thereby ensuring we were in a position to continue with
our programme of capital investment across the group once the impact of the pandemic started to recede.
•
We are pleased to report that we were largely to comply with these objectives with the support of Economic Resilience Gran
from Welsh Government and the utilisation of the Job Retention Scheme furlough grants from HMRC. In addition, the company
disposed of its Park Fumishers Store at Willway Street, Bristol with the proceeds of sale earmarked for future capital investment
projects and ensuring we complied with our facility Emits and the financial covenants contained in our banking facility
agreements. Trading in the new Park Furnishers store in Eastgate Retail Park, Bristol has been very encouraging, exceeding
expectations since opening in April 2021.
Despite the substantial reduction in turnover, the various measures undertaken meant that the group improved on many of its key
performance measures as follows:

restricted during several periods in the year.

Sales orders generated were down 42% (£27m) on the prior year and this is considered to be best measurement of the impact of
the Covid-19 restrictions. However, the company benefited from a very strong pipeline position at the start of the financial
This pipeline position represents sales orders generated in the previous accounting year but delivered in the current financial year
(once restrictions were lifted to allow customer deliveries to take place) and therefore recognised in the accounts in the current
financial year.
Despite the benefit of this strong pipeline position at the start of the financial year attributable to sales orders taken before the
onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, delivered sales were still £19.3m (32%) down on the prior year due to the restrictions on trading
in place.
Despite the fall in delivered sales, the EBITDA and profit before tax outcomes improved on the prior year due to the significant

Key performance indicators - Leekes Limited
The directors closely monitor the business performance through the use of both financial and non-financial KPIs. Financial KPIs
are used at the three main levels of the business - by store, by business unit and by department and include:
- Sales targets by store, department and section
- Sales and profitability by store and department
- Pipeline sales orders generated
-Gross margin targets
- Additional income generated by salesman
- Return on store investment targets
- Cash flow targets based on the cash flow generated from profitability, working capital movements and control of capital
expenditure budgets
The directors monitor the performance on the KPIs on a daily, weekly or monthly basis as appropriate and this close control has
contributed to the EBITDA improvement of over £2m achieved in the last three years.
Non-financial KPIs used include mystery shopper surveys, delivery satisfaction surveys, staff retention levels, lead generation and
sales conversions by salesman and ensure our team is working together to improve customer satisfaction, employce engagement
and future business.

Post year-end trading review - Leekes Retail
The company's delivered sales have been impacted post year-end by the closure of its stores during the key winter sale period.
However, sales orders generation since reopening has been very strong. This coupled with continued focus on operating
effectiveness and cost controls has meant that the profits for the 5 months to 31 August 2021 are up on the prior year as follows:

Performance review - Vale Resort
The Vale Resort has performed very well for successive years.
Prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the forward bookings indicated that the Vale Resort would achieve significant
revenues and profits in this financial year. However, it was significantly impacted by the Covid-19 related restrictions with the
Resort either closed or significantly impacted throughout the vast majority of the year which resulted in turnover being down
£8.9m (63%) on the prior year.
The Resort undertook a number of measures to mitigate the impact of the significant fall in turnover, including:
• Implementation of cost control measures including utilisation of the Job Retention Scheme furlough grant which have
ensured that the payroll headcount is now close to pre-pandemic levels;
• The receipt of Economic Resilience Fund grants from Welsh Government;
• Maximising trading in periods when the Resort was allowed to open, albeit still under restrictions.
The impact of these measures meant that the Resort generated a positive EBITDA in the period. However the restrictions
implemented resulted in a significant fall in turnover which prevented the company from realising the profits on the considerable
amount of business on the books for 2020/21 that was already in place before Covid-19 occurred:

new leisure membership targets, leisure membership retention targets, spa and golf course utilisations. The directors compare the
performance on these KPIs against both the internal budgets and targets set and against competitor benchmarking data. The
directors are pleased to report that the Vale Resort has consistently outperformed its competitor set in respect of profitability per
available room over an extended period. Non-financial KPIs include customer and member feedback surveys, mystery shopper
programmes, staff retention levels and sales conversion targets.

J.H. LEEKE AND SONS LIMITED
STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021
Principal risk and uncertainties
The group has moderate exposure to variations in interest rates and foreign exchange. At present, the directors do not consider it
necessary to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. However, during 2019/20 the group took advantage of a 3
month Libor 10 year swap rate of 0.8825% per annum which will protect it against interest rate volatility over that period. The
business is monitored for changes in the risk profile of such exposure and will consider using other financial instruments and
derivatives as appropriate.
The group has some exposure to credit or liquidity risk on its trade receivables but this is not significant relative to the size of its
balance sheet due to the fact that it is principally a cash-based business. Cash flow risks, relating to demands of working capital,
are mitigated through the careful management of stock holdings, review of supplier credit terms, and the management of cash on a
group-wide basis to meet the group's cash requirements.
Future prospects and going concern
The group will continue to operate in the business areas in which it is engaged and aims to exploit new activities as they arise.
The group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through a composite account facility and debt facilities provided by
the group's bankers. Despite the challenges brought about by the severe Covid-19 restrictions introduced, the group complied with
all its banking covenants which includes a Revolving Credit Facility of £28m and a Term Loan of £10m which along with the cash
generated from the strong profitability being generated allows the group to continue to invest in its core operations.
Hensol Castle Distillery has been an excellent addition to the group, has traded strongly in 2020/21 to date and is projected to
continue to have a very positive effect on group profitability and cash generation.
The group's current bank financing deal is due for renewal in February 2022. The directors are pleased to report that the group has
agreed Heads of Terms for a £35m facility comprising a £30m Revolving Credit Facility and a £5m term loan to be amortised over
the three year term.
The group has net assets of approximately £75m at 31 March 2021 which includes substantial freehold property valuations and has
sufficient headroom on all its banking covenants including interest cover and loan to value and gearing ratios.
Furthermore, the group's forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance on the
back of any further possible disruption to trading caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, show that the group has sufficient liquidity to
operate within the level of its current facilities for at least the next 12 months. Net assets have increased to approximately £78m at
the date of reporting further illustrating the robustness of our balance sheet.
Group revenues and profitability have rebounded strongly post year-end as follows:

DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have
elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and company, and of the profit or
loss of the group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the financial statements;
prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the group's and
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.

J.H. LEEKE AND SONS LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF J.H. LEEKE AND SONS LIMITED
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of J.H. Lecke and Sons Limited (the parent company') and its subsidiaries (the 'group')
for the year ended 31 March 2021 which comprise the group profit and loss account, the group statement of comprehensive
income, the group balance sheet, the company balance sheet, the group statement of changes in equity, the company statement of
changes in equity, the group statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting
policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and the parent company's affairs as at 31 March 2021 and of the
group's profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAS (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit
of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities
in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the
preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,
individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern
for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of
this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's
report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the
financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do
not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of
the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements
themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

J.H. LEEKE AND SONS LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBERS OF J.H. LEEKE AND SONS LIMITED
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course
of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our
opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or
the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
•
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the parent company's ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a
high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material
misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our
responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which
our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.
Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstaternent in respect of irregularities, including fraud and
non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:
the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence, capabilities and
skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the group through discussions with directors and other management,
and from our commercial knowledge and experience of the relevant sector;
we focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial
statements or the operations of the company, including the Companies Act 2006 and ISO standards;
we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making enquiries of
management and inspecting legal correspondence; and
identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained alert to
instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.
•
•
We assessed the susceptibility of the group's financial statements to material misstatement, including obtaining an understanding
of how fraud might occur, by:
• making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of actual,
suspected and alleged fraud; and
considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations.
- 12 -
J.H. LEEKE AND SONS LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBERS OF J.H. LEEKE AND SONS LIMITED
To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:
• performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships:
tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions;
assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining the accounting estimates were indicative of potential
bias; and
• investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions.
•
There are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and regulations are from
financial statements, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance. Auditing standards also limit the audit
procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and
the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.
Material misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may involve
deliberate concealment or collusion.
A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for
the opinions we have formed.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021

Accounting policies
Company information
J.H. Leeke and Sons Limited (""the company”) is a limited company domiciled and incorporated in England and Wales. The
registered office is Mwyndy Business Park, Mwyndy, Pontyclun, Mid Glamorgan, Wales, CF72 8PN.
The group consists of J.H. Lecke and Sons Limited and all of its subsidiaries.
1.1
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 “The Financial Reporting Standard applicable
in the UK and Republic of Ireland"" (""FRS 102"") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary amounts in
these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.
The financial statements ave been prepared un the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of
freehold properties and to include investment properties and certain financial instruments at fair value. The principal
accounting policies adopted are set out below.
of a
group
which prepares
The company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, being the parent company
publicly available consolidated financial statements, including this company, which are intended to give a true and fair
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group. The company has therefore taken advantage
of exemptions from the following disclosure requirements for parent company information presented within the
consolidated financial statements:
• Section 4 'Statement of Financial Position - Reconciliation of the opening and closing number of shares;
• Section 7 'Statement of Cash Flows' - Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and disclosures;
Section 11 Basic Financial Instruments and Section 12 'Other Financial Instrument Issues - Carrying amounts,
interest income/expense and net gains/losses for each category of financial instrument; basis of determining fair
values; details of collateral, loan defaults or breaches, details of hedges, hedging fair value changes recognised in
profit or loss and in other comprehensive income;
• Section 26 *Share based Payment' - Share-based payment expense charged to profit or loss, reconciliation of
opening and closing number and weighted average exercise price of share options, how the fair value of options
granted was measured, measurement and carrying amount of liabilities for cash-settled share-based payments,
explanation of modifications to arrangements;
• Section 33 *Related Party Disclosures' - Compensation for key management personnel.
1.2
Basis of consolidation
In the parent company financial statements, the cost of a business combination is the fair value at the acquisition date of the
assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed, plus costs directly attributable to the business
combination. The excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities acquired is recognised as goodwill. The cost of the combination includes the estimated amount of
contingent consideration that is probable and can be measured reliably, and is adjusted for changes in contingent
consideration after the acquisition date. Provisional fair values recognised for business combinations in previous periods
are adjusted retrospectively for final fair values determined in the 12 months following the acquisition date. Investments in
subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment.

J.H. LEEKE AND SONS LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021

Accounting policies
(Continued)
The consolidated financial statements incorporate those of J.H. Leeke and Sons Limited and all of its subsidiaries (ie
entities that the group controls through its power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic
benefits). Subsidiaries acquired during the year are consolidated using the purchase method. Their results are incorporated
from the date that control passes.
All financial statements are made up to 31 March 2021. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements
of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other members of the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated on
consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset
transferred.
Entities in which the group holds an interest and which are jointly controlled by the group and one or more other venturers
under a contractual arrangement are treated as joint ventures. Entities other than subsidiary undertakings or joint ventures.
in which the group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies the group exercises a
significant influence, are treated as associates.
1.3
Going concern
The Covid-19 pandemic and the measures implemented by the government to combat it meant the group saw periods of
closure during the year for both its retail stores and the Vale Resort. However, through the implementation of operational
efficiencies which have resulted in considerable cost savings, drawing on the government COVID support schemes and
encouraging retail sales (both from the physical stores and the online operation) and Vale Resort revenues post lockdown,
the financial position of the group remains robust.
Group revenues and profitability have rebounded strongly post year-end as follows:
5 months to
5 months to

£2.99m

Therefore, at the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus the directors continue to adopt
the going concerr. basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
The group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through a composite account facility and a revolving loan
provided by the group's bankers.
The group's banking facilities were renewed in February 2019 by its bankers Barclays Bank Plc and Lloyds Bank Plc on
favourable terms. The group is able to take advantage of a £28 million Revolving Credit Facility (""RCF"") and a £10 million
Term Loan which along with the cash generated from the strong profitability being generated allows the group to continue
to invest in its core operations.
The group's current bank financing deal is due for renewal in February 2022. The directors are pleased to report that the
group has agreed Heads of Terms for a £35m facility comprising a £30m Revolving Credit Facility and a £5m term loan to
be amortised over the three year term.

1.4
Turnover
Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the
normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of consideration takes into
account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.
When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the consideration is the present
value of the future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the nominal amount received is
recognised as interest income.
Revenue from concession sales is shown on a net basis, being the commission received or receivable rather than the gross
value of the sale.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed
to the buyer (usually on dispatch of the goods), the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that the
economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect
of the transaction can be measured reliably.
1.5
Intangible fixed assets - goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of an incorporated business over the fair value of net assets
acquired. It is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is considered to have a finite useful life and is amortised on a systematic
basis over its expected life, which the board considers to be 100 years for goodwill arising from the acquisition of Park
Furnishers (Bristol) Limited and 10 years for goodwill arising from the acquisition of Bottlers & Distillers (Wales) Limited.
Refer to note 2 for further detail.
1.6
Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired on business combinations are recognised separately from goodwill at the acquisition date where
it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity and the fair
value of the asset can be measured reliably; the intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights; and the
intangible asset is separable from the entity.
Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives
on the following bases:
Trademarks
Straight line basis over 10 years
1.7
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and
any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their useful lives
on the following bases:
Freehold land and buildings
Investment property
Not depreciated
Not depreciated
8% or 15% reducing balance or 10% to 20% straight line
8% to 20% reducing balance or 8.3% to 33% straight line

J.H. LEEKE AND SONS LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021

Accounting policies
(Continued)
Freehold land and buildings are not depreciated as, in the opinion of the directors, the residual values of the properties are
not lower than their value at the date of acquisition. An annual impairment review is carried out by the directors in respect
of these buildings.
Revaluations of freehold and leasehold land and buildings are undertaken with sufficient regularity to ensure that the
carrying value does not materially differ from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting
period. The surplus or deficit on book value is transferred to the revaluation reserve, except that a deficit which is in excess
of any previously recognised surplus over depreciated cost relating to the property, or the reversal of such a deficit, is
charged (or credited) to the profit and loss account. A deficit which represents a clear consumption of economic benefits is
charged to the profit and loss account regardless of any such previous surplus.
The investment property is revalued annually. Any surplus or deficit is transferred to the revaluation reserve, unless the
deficit is in excess of any previously recognised surplus. Depreciation is not provided in respect of the investment property.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and the
carrying value of the asset, and is recognised in the profit and loss account.
1.8
Investment properties
Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation, is initially recognised at cost,
which includes the purchase cost and any directly attributable expenditure. Subsequently it is measured at fair value at the
reporting end date. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.
Where fair value cannot be achieved without undue cost or effort, investment property is accounted for as a tangible fixed
asset.
1.9
Fixed asset investments
Equity investments are measured at fair value through profit or loss, except for those equity investments that are not
publicly traded and whose fair value cannot otherwise be measured reliably, which are recognised at cost less impairment
until a reliable measure of fair value becomes available.
In the parent company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are initially measured at cost and subsequently
measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the
entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
1.10 Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting period end date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company estimates the recoverable amount of the
cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The carrying amount of the investments accounted for using the equity method is tested for impairment as a single asset.
Any goodwill included in the carrying amount of the investment is not tested separately for impairment.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2021

Accounting policies
(Continued)
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been
adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised
immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is
treated as a revaluation decrease.
Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to apply. Where
an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the
revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior
years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a
revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
1.11 Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost comprises direct
materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the stocks to
their present location and condition.
Stocks held for distribution at no or nominal consideration are measured at the lower of the lower of cost and replacement
cost, adjusted where applicable for any loss of service potential.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks over its
estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or loss. Reversals of
impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.
1.12 Financial instruments
The group has elected to apply the provisions of Section [] 'Basic Financial Instruments and Section 12 *Other Financial
Instruments Issues' of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the group's balance sheet when the group becomes party to the contractual
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amounts presented in the financial statements when there is a legally
enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and
settle the liability simultaneously.
Basic financial assets
Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction price
including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method unless the
arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value of the future receipts
discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one year are not amortised.
Other financial assets
Other financial assets, including investments in equity instruments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures,
are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price. Such assets are subsequently carried at fair
value and the changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, except that investments in equity instruments that are
not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost less impairment.

Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each
reporting end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the
initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected. If an asset is impaired, the
impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted
at the asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the
impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount
would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is recognised in profit or
loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are settled, or
when the group transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity, or if
some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has transferred to another party that is
able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.
Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered
into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of
its liabilities.
Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans and loans from fellow group companies, are initially recognised at
transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the
present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within
one year are not amortised.
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from
suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are
presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently measured
at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Other financial liabilities
Derivatives, including interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, are not basic financial instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
re-measured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in profit or loss in finance costs or
finance income as appropriate, unless hedge accounting is applied and the hedge is a cash flow hedge.
Debt instruments that do not meet the conditions in FRS 102 paragraph 11.9 are subsequently measured at fair value
through profit or loss. Debt instruments may be designated as being measured at fair value through profit or loss to
eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch or if the instruments are measured and their performance evaluated on a fair
valuc basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the group's contractual obligations expire or are discharged or cancelled.

Accounting policies

1.13 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the
profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable
profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the initial
recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it is no
longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax
is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items charged or credited
directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if,
and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and
liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.
1.14 Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefi:s are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are required to be
recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.
Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to terminate
the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.
1.15 Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The cost of providing benefits under defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit
credit method, and is based on actuarial advice.
The change in the net defined benefit liability arising from employee service during the year is recognised as an employee
cost. The cost of plan introductions, benefit changes, settlements and curtailments are recognised as an expense in
measuring profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
The net interest element is determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability by the discount rate, taking into
account any changes in the net defined benefit liability during the period as a result of contribution and benefit payments.
The net interest is recognised in profit or loss as other finance revenue or cost.
Remeasurement changes comprise actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on the net defined
benefit liability excluding amounts included in net interest. These are recognised immediately in other comprehensive
income in the period in which they occur and are not reclassified to profit and loss in subsequent periods.

(Continued)
The net defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value
of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds), less the fair value of plan
assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information, and in the case
of quoted securities is the published bid price. The value of a net pension benefit asset is limited to the amount that may be
recovered either through reduced contributions or agreed refunds from the scheme.
1.16 Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to the lessees. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets at the lower of the assets fair value at the date of inception and the
present value of the minimum lease payments. The related liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease
obligation, Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The interest is charged to profit or loss
so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a straight
line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time
pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct
costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and
recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
1.17 Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable assurance
that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.
A grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised in income when the performance conditions are met. Where a
grant does not specify performance conditions it is recognised in income when the proceeds are received or receivable. A
grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the group's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The
estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the
revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements
The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on amounts
recognised in the financial statements.
Going concern
The application of the going concern basis is discussed in 1.3 above. In order to assess whether it is appropriate for the
group to be reported as a going concern, the directors apply judgement, having undertaken appropriate enquiries and having
considered the business activities and the group's principal risks and uncertainties as set in the strategic report.
In arriving at this judgement there are a large number of assumptions and estimates involved in calculating these future cash
flow projections. This includes management's expectations of revenue, EBITDA, timing and quantum of future capital
expenditure and estimates and cost of future funding.
Revenue recognition
The group had revenue of £50,456,899 (2020: £75,837,360) for the year ended 31 March 2021. Revenue from concession
sales is shown on a net basis, being the commission received rather than the gross value achieved on the sale. The gross
transaction value, which presents revenue on a gross basis before adjusting for concessions, during the year and a
reconciliation to the group's reported turnover is presented in note 3.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of
assets and liabilities are as follows.
Carrying value of tangible fixed assets and frequency of valuation
A key area of estimation uncertainty relates to the carrying value of the group's tangible fixed assets. As at 31 March 2021
the group had tangible fixed assets including investment property of £86,405,929 (2020: £89,833,768). The land and
buildings held by the group were revalued at 31 March 2014 by DTZ Chartered Surveyors, independent valuers not
connected with the company, on an existing use value basis. The directors re-considered the value at 31 March 2016
applying the same principles; overall the carrying value was reduced by £156,672. The directors undertook further reviews
at 31 March 2017, 31 March 2018, 31 March 2019, 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 and concluded that there was no
significant movement in carrying value of freehold and leasehold land and buildings. The investment properties were
revalued at 31 March 2019 by Fisher German LLP and Cushman & Wakefield, independent valuers not connected with the
group, on a fair value basis. Overall the carrying value of the group's tangible fixed assets including investment property
exceed depreciated historical cost by £15,655,458.

Impairment of goodwill
As at 31 March 2020 the group had goodwill of £2,104,703 (2020: £2,895,142). An exceptional impairment charge of
£758,980 has been recognised in the year, refer to note 9.
Purchased goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable assets
and liabilities acquired net of accumulated amortisation. The goodwill relates to the acquisition of Park Furnishers (Bristol)
Limited and Bottlers & Distillers (Wales) Limited. The goodwill is being amortised over the estimated useful economic life
which the board considers to be 100 years for goodwill arising from the acquisition of Park Furnishers (Bristol) Limited and
10 years for goodwill arising from the acquisition of Bottlers & Distillers (Wales) Limited.
FRS 102 does not permit goodwill to be assigned an indefinite life. The board has concluded that whilst the life of the
goodwill is not indefinite, the durability of the business acquired is such that the life is expected to be long lasting and the
value of the acquired goodwill is not expected to diminish significantly.
The durability of the business acquired, Park Furnishers (Bristol) Limited, is characterised by factors such as the stability of
the sector, low technology, long lifespan of store and the product offering, high sustainable demand and high barriers to
entry. The nature of the acquired business and the market in which it operates means that the goodwill should have a long
economic life providing that the business continues to be run as effectively. As a result, there is no individual aspect of the
acquisition that will diminish over time. Therefore, the board selected 100 years as being a reasonable period over which to
amortise the goodwill since an indefinite life is not permitted and arbitrarily amortising goodwill over a shorter period
would not reflect the economics of the business.
Bottlers & Distillers (Wales) Limited was acquired as a relatively new business and therefore the board consider 10 years to
be a more appropriate period over which to amortise the goodwill.
The value of the business and goodwill is assessed for impairment against carrying values on an annual basis in accordance
with FRS102 ""Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill"". Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account in the
period in which it arises.
During the current year the store in Bedminster was closed and the Park Furnishers business was relocated to a new site in
Bristol. The board re-evaluated the goodwill and recognised an impairment of £758,980 (refer to note 9); whilst trading at
the new site has been better than expected the board recognises that location and the long lifespan of the old store was
undoubtedly an element of the original goodwill.
The determination of the useful economic life is clearly a significant judgment; a significantly shorter life would result in
significantly greater amortisation charge in the profit and loss account.
The assessment for impairment involves estimating the recoverable amount, which involves estimation of the future cash
flows of the cash generating Unit (CGU) and also the selection of an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate the net
present value of those cash flows. This clearly required significant judgement and estimation uncertainty.

During the prior year the group incurred exceptional costs relating to one off building repair work.
During the year the group made redundancies with total costs of £560,262.
In April 2020 the group sold its Park Furnishers store in Bedminster, Bristol in order to relocate to another site within
Bristol. This sale generated an exceptional profit on disposal of £3,958,286.
The group's balance sheet includes goodwill related to the purchase of subsidiary company Park Furnishers (Bristol)
Limited in year ended 31 March 2017. As a result of the relocation of the Park Furnishers store during the year, the board
considered it prudent to write down the carrying value of this goodwill recognising that store location and the lifespan at
the old store was undoubtedly an element of the original goodwill. An exceptional impairment charge of £758,980 has been
recognised in the year. The board is satisfied that the results from the new store support the remaining goodwill.
Amounts recognised in the profit and loss account in the current year in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme
include £30,000 of past service costs.
On 30 March 2021 the group purchased the remaining 25% of shares in subsidiary company Bottlers & Distillers (Wales)
Limited from its former directors, increasing its shareholding to 100%. As part of the agreement to leave, £60,000 was paid
to the former directors of Bottlers & Distillers (Wales) Limited.
During the prior year the group entered into an interest rate swap. This has generated an exceptional gain on fair value
movement of £322,636 (2020: loss of £368,609).

year ended 31 March 2017. In April 2020 the company sold its Park Furnishers store in Bedminster, Bristol in order to
relocate to another site within Bristol. As a result of the relocation of the Park Furnishers store during the year, the board
considered it prudent to write down the carrying value of this goodwill recognising that store location and the lifespan at the
old store was undoubtedly an element of the original goodwill. An exceptional impairment charge of £758,980 has been
recognised in the year. The board is satisfied that the results from the new store support the remaining goodwill.

Tangible fixed assets
(Continued)
The land and buildings held by the group were revalued at 31 March 2014 by DTZ Chartered Surveyors, independent
valuers not connected with the company, on an existing use value basis. The directors re-considered the value at 31 March
2016 applying the same principles; overall the carrying value was reduced by £156,672. The directors undertook further
reviews at 31 March 2017, 31 March 2018, 31 March 2019, 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2021 and concluded that there
was no significant movement in carrying value of freehold and leasehold land and buildings.
The investment properties were revalued at 31 March 2019 by Fisher German LLP and Cushman & Wakefield, independent
valuers not connected with the company, on a fair value basis. In 2019 a revaluation gain of £825,040 on investment
property was included within the profit and loss account.
If tangible fixed assets including investment property were stated on an historical cost basis rather than a fair value basis,
the total amounts included would have been as follows:

A defined contribution pension scheme is operated for all qualifying employees. The assets of the scheme are held
separately from those of the group in an independently administered fund.
At the year end the group had outstanding pension contributions of £41,997 (2020: £63,528), this amount being included
within creditors due within one year. In addition the group had also accrued £20,000 (2020: £nil) at the year end in respect
of defined benefit pension contributions for the year, this amount being included within creditors due within one year.
Defined benefit schemes
The group also operates a defined benefit pension scheme that was acquired as part of the hive-up of the trade and assets of
Cole of Bilston Limited on 19 November 2009. This provides pension benefits for members based on their earnings close
to retirement and whose assets are held separately from those of the company. The fund is now closed to new entrants.
The pension cost has been determined on the basis of the long-term contribution rate to the plan expressed as a level
percentage of pensionable payroll which has to be paid in the future to provide the plan benefits. It is the company's
intention to contribute to the plan at the long-term contribution rate disclosed in the periodic actuarial valuation.
The pension cost for the year has been assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary by reference to the
most recent full actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2021,
A qualified actuary has calculated the position at 31 March 2021 for the purposes of complying with the requirements of
FRS 102 for the current year.

Aces Academies Trust,597.59,216.4,0.0,813.99,"ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2021
Review of value for money
As accounting officer the principal has responsibility for ensuring that the academy trust delivers good value in the use of
public resources. The accounting officer understands that value for money refers to the educational and wider societal
outcomes achieved in return for the taxpayer resources received.
The accounting officer considers how the academy trust's use of its resources has provided good value for money during
each academic year, and reports to the board of trustees where value for money can be improved, including the use of
benchmarking data where available. The accounting officer for the academy trust has delivered improved value for money
during the year by:
1. Robust governance and oversight of Trust finances
The Trust benefits from the provision by CEFM of a suitably qualified Responsible Officer (RO). The RO reviews key
financial policies, systems and procedures, including the use of tenders and presents reports on compliance to the
Trustees through the Finance and Premises Committee.
The Trust benefits from the provision by Azets of Annual Accounts Return, Budget Submission and External Audit.
The Chair of the Finance and Premises Committee meets regularly with the Director of Finance and HR and Finance
Manager to review the management accounts and to receive budget monitoring reports at least termly.
The full Board approves the budget each year and is mindful of the need to balance expenditure against income to ensure
the Trust remains a 'going concern'. The Board also receives and approves the Annual Accounts and the External
Auditors Management Report.
2. Ensuring the operation of the Trust demonstrates good value for money and efficient and effective use of
resources
The Trust regularly benchmarks financial performance against other trusts to demonstrate that the Trust provides good
value for money. Such benchmarking is provided annually by Azets.
Tender exercises are regularly undertaken to ensure that high value contracts are assessed against the marketplace on a
regular basis to ensure that long term contracts (3 to 5 years) remain competitive. The Finance and Premises Committee
review the contracts schedule annually.
For purchases above £2,000 but below the tender limit 3 quotes are required.
3. Maximising income generation
The Trust explores every opportunity to generate income through hire of Trust facilities for community sports and
commercial hire of the Performing Arts Centre and Hinchingbrooke House.

ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2021
4. Reviewing controls and managing risks.
Monthly budget monitoring reports are produced and reviewed by the Chair of the Finance and Premises Committee and
the Director of Finance & HR and the CEO and any necessary remedial action taken to address any significant variances
that may have an impact on the budget out-turn.
The Trust ensures that all surplus cash balances are invested in interest bearing accounts to maximise interest earning
potential. Indeed the selection of the Trust's banking provider was put out to tender with investment opportunities being
one of the key selection criteria.
The Trust maintains a risk register that they review annually. The register is also reviewed by the RO. There are currently
no major risks that have not had adequate control measures applied.
5. Reviewing operations to maximise use of resources.
The Trust's Senior Leadership, led by the CEO and Director of Finance & HR, review expenditure within each budget
heading annually and make adjustments based on the effectiveness of strategies introduced in previous years, curriculum
offer and any new strategies identified in the Strategic Development Plan.
6. Use of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency and positive impact on the environment.
The Trust is progressing an Energy Performance Contract that will see dramatic reductions in energy usage, significant
reductions in CO2 emissions. This long term project over time will generate significant savings in the operational running
costs of the Hinchingbrooke School.
The purpose of the system of internal control
The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure to
achieve policies, aims and objectives. It can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance of
effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an on-going process designed to identify and prioritise the risks
to the achievement of academy trust policies, aims and objectives, to evaluate the likelihood of those risks being realised
and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically. The system of
internal control has been in place in Trust for the year ended 31 August 2020 and up to the date of approval of the annual
report and financial statements.
Capacity to handle risk
The Trustees have reviewed the key risks to which the academy trust is exposed together with the operating, financial
and compliance controls that have been implemented to mitigate those risks. The Trustees are of the view that there is a
formal on-going process for identifying, evaluating and managing the Trust's significant risks that has been in place for the
year ending 31 August 2021 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and financial statements. This process is
regularly reviewed by the governing body.
- 15-
ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
GOVERNANCE STATEMENT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2021
The risk and control framework
The Trust's system of internal financial control is based on a framework of regular management information and
administrative procedures including the segregation of duties and a system of delegation and accountability. In particular,
it includes:
- comprehensive budgeting and monitoring systems with an annual budget and periodic financial reports which are
reviewed and agreed by the Trustees;
- regular reviews by the finance and premises committee of reports which indicate financial performance against the
forecasts and of major purchase plans, capital works and expenditure programmes;
- setting targets to measure financial and other performance;
- clearly defined purchasing (asset purchase or capital investment) guidelines;
-delegation of authority and segregation of duties;
- identification and management of risks.
The Trustees have considered the need for a specific internal audit function and has decided not to appoint an internal
auditor. However, the Trustees have appointed the Centre for Education and Finance Management (CEFM) to perform
the duties of a Responsible Officer ('RO'). The RO's role includes giving advice on financial matters and performing a
range of checks on the academy trust's financial systems. On a regular basis, the RO reports to the governing body on
the operation of the systems of control and on the discharge of the governing body's financial responsibilities.
During the year two RO reports were produced and no details of any material control issues were identified.
Review of effectiveness
As Accounting Officer, Mr A Goulding has responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control.
During the year in question the review has been informed by:
- the work of the Responsible Officer;
- the work of the external auditor;
- the financial management and governance self assessment process;
- the work of the executive managers within the academy trust who have responsibility for the development
- and maintenance of the internal control framework.
The Accounting Officer has been advised of the implications of the result of their review of the system of internal control
by the finance committee and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in
place.

STATEMENT OF REGULARITY, PROPRIETY AND COMPLIANCE
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2021
As accounting officer of Aces Academies Trust, I have considered my responsibility to notify the academy trust board of
trustees and the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) of material irregularity, impropriety and non-compliance
with terms and conditions of all funding received by the academy trust, under the funding agreement in place between the
academy trust and the Secretary of State for Education. As part of my consideration I have had due regard to the
requirements of the Academies Financial Handbook 2020.
I confirm that I and the academy trust's board of trustees are able to identify any material irregular or improper use of
funds by the academy trust, or material non-compliance with the terms and conditions of funding under the academy
trust's funding agreement and the Academies Financial Handbook 2020.
I confirm that no instances of material irregularity, impropriety or funding non-compliance have been discovered to date. If
any instances are identified after the date of this statement, these will be notified to the board of trustees and ESFA.

ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
STATEMENT OF TRUSTEES' RESPONSIBILITIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2021
The trustees (who are also the directors of Aces Academies Trust for the purposes of company law) are responsible for
preparing the trustees' report and the accounts in accordance with the Academies Accounts Direction 2020 to 2021
published by the Education and Skills Funding Agency, United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) and applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the trustees to prepare accounts for each financial year. Under company law, the trustees must not
approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the charitable
company and of its incoming resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for that period.
In preparing these accounts, the trustees are required to:
•
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• observe the methods and principles in the Charities SORP 2019 and the Academies Accounts Direction 2020 to
2021;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the accounts; and
prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the charitable company
will continue in business.
•
•
The trustees are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
charitable company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
charitable company and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charitable company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The trustees are responsible for ensuring that in its conduct and operation the charitable company applies financial and
other controls, which conform with the requirements both of propriety and of good financial management. They are also
responsible for ensuring that grants received from ESFA/DfE have been applied for the purposes intended.
The trustees are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the
charitable company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of accounts
may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2021
Opinion
We have audited the accounts of Aces Academies Trust for the year ended 31 August 2021 which comprise the
statement of financial activities, the balance sheet, the statement of cash flows and the notes to the accounts, including a
summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial
Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice), the Charities SORP 2019 and the Academies Accounts Direction 2020 to 2021 issued by the Education and
Skills Funding Agency.
In our opinion the accounts:
give a true and fair view of the state of the charitable company's affairs as at 31 August 2021 and of its incoming
resources and application of resources, including its income and expenditure, for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice;
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and
have been prepared in accordance with the Charities SORP 2019 and the Academies Accounts Direction 2020 to
2021.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the accounts'
section of our report. We are independent of the academy trust in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the accounts in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other
ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the trustees' use of the going concern basis of accounting in
the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the academy trust's ability to continue as a going concern for
a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the trustees with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.
Other information
The trustees are responsible for the other information, which comprises the information included in the annual report other
than the accounts and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the accounts does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the accounts, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider
whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the accounts or our knowledge obtained in the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the accounts or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.

ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
(CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2021
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
the information given in the trustees' report including the incorporated strategic report for the financial year for which
the accounts are prepared is consistent with the accounts; and
the trustees' report including the incorporated strategic report has been prepared in accordance with applicable
legal requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the academy trust and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the trustees' report, including the incorporated strategic report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to
report to you if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or
the accounts are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of trustees' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of trustees
As explained more fully in the statement of trustees' responsibilities, the trustees are responsible for the preparation of the
accounts and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the trustees determine
is necessary to enable the preparation of accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the accounts, the trustees are responsible for assessing the academy trust's ability to continue as a going
concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting
unless the trustees either intend to liquidate the charitable company, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the accounts
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the accounts as a whole are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAS (UK) will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered
material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of
users taken on the basis of these accounts.
Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above and on the Financial Reporting Council's website, to detect material
misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.
We obtain and update our understanding of the entity, its activities, its control environment, and likely future
developments, including in relation to the legal and regulatory framework applicable and how the entity is complying with
that framework. Based on this understanding, we identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. This includes consideration of the risk
of acts by the entity that were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud.
- 20 -
ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
(CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2021
In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, including fraud, we designed
procedures which included:
• Enquiry of senior leadership, Governors/Trustees and those charged with governance around actual and potential
litigation and claims as well as actual, suspected and alleged fraud;
• Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;
• Assessing the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations considered to have a direct material effect on the
financial statements or the operations of the company through enquiry and inspection;
• Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with
applicable laws and regulations including compliance with the Academies Accounts Direction 2020 to 2021 issued
by the Education and Skills Funding Agency;
• Performing audit work over the recognition of grant income and the allocation of expenditure to funds;
• Performing audit work over the risk of management bias and override of controls, including testing of journal
entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, evaluating the rationale of significant transactions outside the
normal course of business and reviewing accounting estimates for indicators of potential bias.
Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those
leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the
more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the accounts is located on the Financial Reporting Council's
website at: http://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the charitable company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of
the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the charitable company's
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the charitable company and the
charitable company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
INDEPENDENT REPORTING ACCOUNTANT'S ASSURANCE REPORT ON REGULARITY TO
ACES ACADEMIES TRUST AND THE EDUCATION AND SKILLS FUNDING AGENCY
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2021
In accordance with the terms of our engagement letter dated 26 August 2021 and further to the requirements of the
Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) as included in the Academies Accounts Direction 2020 to 2021, we have
carried out an engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the expenditure disbursed and income received by
Aces Academies Trust during the period 1 September 2020 to 31 August 2021 have been applied to the purposes
identified by Parliament and the financial transactions conform to the authorities which govern them.
This report is made solely to Aces Academies Trust and ESFA in accordance with the terms of our engagement letter.
Our work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Aces Academies Trust and ESFA those matters we are
required to state in a report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than Aces Academies Trust and ESFA, for our work, for this report, or for the conclusion we
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Aces Academies Trust's accounting officer and the reporting accountant
The accounting officer is responsible, under the requirements of Aces Academies Trust's funding agreement with the
Secretary of State for Education dated 1 September 2011 and the Academies Financial Handbook, extant from 1
September 2020, for ensuring that expenditure disbursed and income received is applied for the purposes intended by
Parliament and the financial transactions conform to the authorities which govern them.
Our responsibilities for this engagement are established in the United Kingdom by our profession's ethical guidance, and
are to obtain limited assurance and report in accordance with our engagement letter and the requirements of the
Academics Accounts Direction 2020 to 2021. We report to you whether anything has come to our attention in carrying out
our work which suggests that in all material respects, expenditure disbursed and income received during the period 1
September 2020 to 31 August 2021 have not been applied to purposes intended by Parliament or that the financial
transactions do not conform to the authorities which govern them.
Approach
We conducted our engagement in accordance with the Framework and Guide for External Auditors and Reporting
Accountant of Academy Trusts issued by ESFA. We performed a limited assurance engagement as defined in our
engagement letter.
The objective of a limited assurance engagement is to perform such procedures as to obtain information and explanations
in order to provide us with sufficient appropriate evidence to express a negative conclusion on regularity.
A limited assurance engagement is more limited in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement and consequently
does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a
reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express a positive opinion.
Our engagement includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the regularity and propriety of the
academy trust's income and expenditure.
•
The work undertaken to draw to our conclusion includes:
a review of the activities of the academy, by reference to sources of income and other information available to us;
• sample testing of expenditure, including payroll;
a review of minutes of governors' meetings

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2021
1
Accounting policies
A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted (which have been applied consistently, except where
noted), judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty, is set out below.
1.1
Basis of preparation
The accounts of the academy trust, which is a public benefit entity under FR$ 102, have been prepared under the
historical cost convention in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic
of Ireland (FR$ 102), the Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice applicable
to charities preparing their accounts in accordance with the Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and
Republic of Ireland (FRS 102) (Charities SORP (FRS 102)), the Academies Accounts Direction 2020 to 2021
issued by ESFA. the Charities Act 2011 and the Companies Act 2006.
1.2
12
Going concern
The trustees assess whether the use of going concern is appropriate i.e. whether there are any material
uncertainties related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the charitable company
to continue as a going concern. The trustees have made this assessment in respect of a period of at least one year
from the date of authorisation for issue of the accounts and have concluded that the academy trust has adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and there are no material uncertainties
about the academy trust's ability to continue as a going concern. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting in preparing the accounts.
The trustees have taken consideration of the effects of COVID-19 in making their assessment.
1.3
Income
All incoming resources are recognised when the academy trust has entitlement to the funds, the receipt is probable
and the amount can be measured reliably.
Grants
Grants are included in the statement of financial activities on a receivable basis. The balance of income received
for specific purposes but not expended during the period is shown in the relevant funds on the balance sheet.
Where income is received in advance of meeting any performance-related conditions there is not unconditional
entitlement to the income and its recognition is deferred and included in creditors as deferred income until the
performance-related conditions are met. Where entitlement occurs before income is received, the income is
accrued.
General Annual Grant is recognised in full in the statement of financial activities in the period for which it is
receivable, and any abatement in respect of the period is deducted from income and recognised as a liability.
Capital grants are recognised in full when there is an unconditional entitlement to the grant. Unspent amounts of
capital grants are reflected in the balance sheet in the restricted fixed asset fund. Capital grants are recognised
when there is entitlement and are not deferred over the life of the asset on which they are expended.
Donations
Donations are recognised on a receivable basis (where there are no performance-related conditions) where the
receipt is probable and the amount can be reliably measured.
Other income
Other income, including the hire of facilities, is recognised in the period it is receivable and to the extent the
academy trust has provided the goods or services.

Accounting policies
(Continued)
Donated goods, facilities and services
Goods donated for resale are included at fair value, being the expected proceeds from sale less the expected costs
of sale. If it is practical to assess the fair value at receipt, it is recognised in stock and 'Income from other trading
activities'. Upon sale, the value of the stock is charged against 'Income from other trading activities' and the
proceeds are recognised as 'Income from other trading activities'. Where it is impractical to fair value the items due
to the volume of low value items they are not recognised in the accounts until they are sold. This income is
recognised within 'Income from other trading activities'.
Donated fixed assets
Donated fixed assets are measured at fair value unless it is impractical to measure this reliably, in which case the
cost of the item to the donor is used. The gain is recognised as income from donations and a corresponding
amount is included in the appropriate fixed asset category and depreciated over the useful economic life in
accordance with the academy trust's accounting policies.
1.4
Expenditure
Expenditure is recognised once there is a legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic benefit to a third
party, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required in settlement, and the amount of the
obligation can be measured reliably.
Expenditure is classified by activity. The costs of each activity are made up of the total of direct costs and shared
costs, including support costs involved in undertaking each activity. Direct costs attributable to a single activity are
allocated directly to that activity. Shared costs which contribute to more than one activity and support costs which
are not attributable to a single activity are apportioned between those activities on a basis consistent with the use
of resources. Central staff costs are allocated on the basis of time spent, and depreciation charges are allocated on
the portion of the asset's use.
All resources expended are inclusive of irrecoverable VAT.
Expenditure on raising funds
This includes all expenditure incurred by the academy trust to raise funds for its charitable purposes and includes
costs of all fundraising activities events and non-charitable trading.
Charitable activities
These are costs incurred on the academy trust's educational operations, including support costs and costs relating
to the governance of the academy trust apportioned to charitable activities.
Governance costs
These include the costs attributable to the academy trust's compliance with constitutional and statutory
requirements, including audit, strategic management, trustees' meetings and reimbursed expenses.

1.5
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Assets costing £1,000 or more are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are carried at cost, net of depreciation
and any provision for impairment.
Where tangible fixed assets have been acquired with the aid of specific grants, either from the government or from
the private sector, they are included in the balance sheet at cost and depreciated over their expected useful
economic life. The related grants are credited to a restricted fixed asset fund in the statement of financial activities
and carried forward in the balance sheet. Depreciation on such assets is charged to the restricted fixed asset fund
in the statement of financial activities so as to reduce the fund over the useful economic life of the related asset on
a basis consistent with the academy trust's depreciation policy. Where tangible fixed assets have been acquired
with unrestricted funds, depreciation on such assets is charged to the unrestricted fund.
Furniture and equipment transferred into the academy from the previous local authority school has not been valued
and introduced into these accounts.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost
of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows:
2% straight-line
Leasehold property
Plant & machinery
Fixtures, fittings & equipment
Motor vehicles
3 years straight-line
3 to 10 years straight-line
3 years straight-line
Assets in the course of construction are included at cost. Depreciation on these assets is not charged until they are
brought into use.
The land and buildings from which the Hinchingbrooke School operate are leased from the local authority and from
The Foundation of Hinchingbrooke School. A valuation was undertaken on the property by a professional valuer at
31 August 2012, commissioned by the ESFA, using a depreciated replacement cost basis. Depreciation is charged
in accordance with the accounting policies set out above.
On 1 January 2018 the leasehold land and buildings in which Cromwell Academy operate were transferred into the
MAT as follows:
- The school building is based on an ESFA valuation as the construction cost was not available at the time of the
transfer.
On 1 September 2020 the leasehold land and buildings in which Godmanchester Community Academy operate
were transferred into the MAT as follows:
- The school building is based on an ESFA valuation dated 31 March 2013 which has subsequently been
depreciated at 2% straight line.
On 1 September 2020 the leasehold land and buildings in which Godmanchester Bridge Academy operate were
transferred into the MAT as follows:
- The school building is based on the construction cost which has subsequently been depreciated at 2% straight
line.
A review for impairment of a fixed asset is carried out if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying value of any fixed asset may not be recoverable. Shortfalls between the carrying value of fixed assets and
their recoverable amounts are recognised as impairments. Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of
financial activities.

1.6
Liabilities
Liabilities are recognised when there an obligation at the balance sheet date as a result of a past event, it is
probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be required in settlement, and the amount of the settlement can be
estimated reliably. Liabilities are recognised at the amount that the academy trust anticipates it will pay to settle the
debt or the amount it has received as advanced payments for the goods of services it must provide.
1.7
Leased assets
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
1.8
Financial instruments
The academy trust only holds basic financial instruments as defined in FRS 102. The financial assets and financial
liabilities of the academy trust and their measurement basis are as follows.
Financial assets
Trade and other debtors are basic financial instruments and are debl instruments measured at amortised cost.
Prepayments are not financial instruments.
Cash at bank is classified as a basic financial instrument and is measured at face value.
Financial liabilitics
Trade creditors, accruals and other creditors are financial instruments, and are measured at amortised cost.
Taxation and social security are not included in the financial instruments disclosure definition.
Deferred income is not deemed to be a financial liability, as the cash settlement has already taken place and there
is an obligation to deliver services rather than cash or another financial instrument.
1.9
Taxation
The academy trust is considered to pass the tests set out in Paragraph 1 Schedule 6 of the Finance Act 2010 and
therefore it meets the definition of a charitable company for UK corporation tax purposes. Accordingly, the academy
trust is potentially exempt from taxation in respect of income or capital gains received within categories covered by
chapter 3 part 11 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 or Section 256 of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, to
the extent that such income or gains are applied exclusively to charitable purposes.
1.10 Pensions benefits
Retirement benefits to employees of the academy trust are provided by the Teachers' Pension Scheme ('TPS') and
the Local Government Pension Scheme ('LGPS'). These are defined benefit schemes and the assets are held
separately from those of the academy trust.
The TPS is an unfunded scheme and contributions are calculated to spread the cost of pensions over employees'
working lives with the academy trust in such a way that the pension cost is a substantially level percentage of
current and future pensionable payroll. The contributions are determined by the Government Actuary based on
quadrennial valuations using a prospective unit credit method. The TPS is an unfunded multi-employer scheme
with no underlying assets to assign between employers. Consequently, the TPS is treated as a defined contribution
scheme for accounting purposes and the contributions are recognised in the period to which they relate.
- 31 -
ACES ACADEMIES TRUST
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 AUGUST 2021
1
Accounting policies
(Continued)
The LGPS is a funded multi-employer scheme and the assets are held separately from those of the academy trust
in separate trustee administered funds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are
measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the
current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liabilities. The
actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date. The amounts
charged to net income or expenditure are the current service costs and the costs of scheme introductions, benefit
changes, settlements and curtailments. They are included as part of staff costs as incurred. Net interest on the net
defined benefit liability/asset is also recognised in the statement of financial activities and comprises the interest
cost on the defined benefit obligation and interest income on the scheme assets, calculated by multiplying the fair
value of the scheme assets at the beginning of the period by the rate used to discount the benefit obligations. The
difference between the interest income on the scheme assets and the actual return on the scheme assets is
recognised in other recognised gains and losses. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in other
recognised gains and losses.
1.11 Fund accounting
Unrestricted income funds represent those resources which may be used towards meeting any of the charitable
objects of the academy trust at the discretion of the trustees.
Restricted fixed asset funds are resources which are to be applied to specific capital purposes imposed by the
funding body where the asset acquired or created is held for a specific purpose.
Restricted general funds comprise all other restricted funds received with restrictions imposed by the funder/donor
and include grants from the Education and Skills Funding Agency and Department for Education.
2
Critical accounting estimates and areas of judgement
Accounting estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other
factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
The academy trust makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates
and assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the
next financial year are discussed below.
The present value of the Local Government Pension Scheme defined benefit liability depends on a number of
factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a variety of assumptions. The assumptions used in
determining the net cost or income for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions,
which are disclosed in note 21, will impact the carrying amount of the pension liability. Furthermore a roll forward
approach which projects results from the latest full actuarial valuation performed at 31 March 2019 has been used
by the actuary in valuing the pensions liability at 31 August 2021. Any differences between the figures derived from
the roll forward approach and a full actuarial valuation would impact on the carrying amount of the pension liability.

Pension and similar obligations
The academy trust's employees belong to two principal pension schemes: the Teachers' Pension Scheme England
and Wales (TPS) for academic and related staff; and the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) for
non-teaching staff, which is managed by Cambridgeshire County Council. Both are multi-employer defined benefit
schemes.
The latest actuarial valuation of the TPS related to the period ended 31 March 2016, and that of the LGPS related
to the period ended 31 March 2019.
Contributions amounting to £217,929 (2020: £176,370) were payable to the schemes at 31 August 2021 and are
included within creditors.
Teachers' Pension Scheme
Introduction
The Teachers' Pension Scheme (TPS) is a statutory, contributory, defined benefit scheme, governed by the
Teachers' Pension Scheme Regulations 2014. Membership is automatic for teachers in academies. All teachers
have the option to opt out of the TPS following enrolment.
The TPS is an unfunded scheme to which both the member and employer makes contributions, as a percentage of
salary. These contributions are credited to the Exchequer. Retirement and other pension benefits are paid by public
funds provided by Parliament.

Valuation of the Teachers' Pension Scheme
The Government Actuary, using normal actuarial principles, conducts a formal actuarial review of the TPS in
accordance with the Public Service Pensions (Valuations and Employer Cost Cap) Directions 2014 published by
HM Treasury every 4 years. The aim of the review is to specify the level of future contributions. Actuarial scheme
valuations are dependent on assumptions about the value of future costs, design of benefits and many other
factors. The latest actuarial valuation of the TPS was carried out as at 31 March 2016. The valuation report was
published by the Department for Education on 5 March 2019.
The key elements of the valuation and subsequent consultation are:
• employer contribution rates set at 23.68% of pensionable pay (including a 0.08% employer administration
charge)
• total scheme liabilities (pensions currently in payment and the estimated cost of future benefits) for service to
the effective date of £218,100 million, and notional assets (estimated future contributions together with the
notional investments held at the valuation date) of £196, 100 million giving a notional past service deficit of
£22,000 million
• the SCAPE rate, set by HMT, is used to determine the notional investment return. The current SCAPE rate is
2.4% above the rate of CPI. The assumed real rate of return is 2.4% in excess of prices and 2% in excess of
earnings. The rate of real earnings growth is assumed to be 2.2%. The assumed nominal rate of return
including earnings growth is 4.45%.
The next valuation result is due to be implemented from 1 April 2023.
The pension costs paid to the TPS in the period amounted to £1,431,242 (2020: £1,158,025).
A copy of the valuation report and supporting documentation is on the Teachers' Pensions website.
Under the definitions set out in FRS 102, the TPS is an unfunded multi-employer pension scheme. The academy
trust has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme. The academy
trust has set out above the information available on the scheme.

The LGPS is a funded defined benefit pension scheme, with the assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The total contributions are as noted below. The agreed contribution rates for future years are 18.1% for employers
and 5.5 to 12.5% for employees.
As described in note the LGPS obligation relates to the employees of the academy trust, being the employees
transferred as part of the conversion from the maintained school and new employees who joined the scheme in the
period. The obligation in respect of employees who transferred on conversion represents their cumulative service at
both the predecessor school and the academy trust at the balance sheet date.
Parliament has agreed, at the request of the Secretary of State for Education, to a guarantee that, in the event of
academy closure, outstanding Local Government Pension Scheme liabilities would be met by the Department for
Education. The guarantee came into force on 18 July 2013.

Related party transactions
Owing to the nature of the academy trust's operations and the composition of the board of trustees being drawn
from local public and private sector organisations, transactions may take place with organisations in which the
academy trust has an interest. All transactions involving such organisations are conducted at arm's length and in
accordance with the academy trust's financial regulations and normal procurement procedures. The following
related party transaction took place in the period of account.
During the year the Hinchingbrooke School received £93,088 (2020: £72,794) from The Hinchingbrooke
Foundation. There are trustees in common to both organisations. The school also occupies property owned by The
Hinchingbrooke Foundation on a rent free basis.
Mrs J Elliot, wife of the chief executive officer of the academy trust, provided educational consultancy services to
the trust in the year amounting to £3,632 (2020 : £4,700).
Some of the trustees have children who are pupils at the academy trust, consequently there will be transactions
between those trustees and the academy trust in respect of their children's education. These are on the same basis
as other pupils at the academy trust.

UNDERWOOD MEAT COMPANY LIMITED
STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2021
The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 October 2021.
Fair review of the business
Our objective is to present a balanced view of group's performance and development during the year and at the year end.
The review will seek to address any risks and uncertainties we face.
The group is predominantly a catering butcher, processing and supplying portion control and bespoke meat to the food
service industry while continuing to develop its range of retail outlets.
The review is based upon known information available to the directors as at the review date.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Our group continues to face competitive pressures and operate in the wider difficult economic climate. As per 2020 and
prior, the weakened GBP weighs heavily on margins, although the ongoing investment in efficiency improvements
lessens the bottom-line impact.
The group, like most in the Retail and Hospitality sector has continued to be directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic
and forced government lockdowns, losing around two thirds of its annualised turnover. Diverse income streams, the job
retention scheme and government grants and reliefs have allowed the business to work through this difficult period,
despite the cautious reopening of indoor hospitality during May 2021.
The Board of Directors are mindful of these risks and uncertainties but remains confident that the overall strategy will
continue to provide a solid platform for the future.
Post balance sheet events
In early December 2021, the government introduced Plan B to reduce the spreading of the COVID-19 Omicron variant
which resulted in significant cancellations to planned events, directly impacting on Underwood Meat's supply into
foodservice and the hospitality sector. The government had removed Plan B by the end of January 2022, which slowly
started to see improvements in the sector.
However, the energy crisis starting late 2021, culminated with the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, has
seen raw material protein prices hit levels never previously seen as well as overheads such as salaries, packaging and
fuel hit record highs.
Underwood Meat has managed the above events by engaging with customers, hedging energy and fuel while ensuring
operational investments are maximised to reduce the requirement for additional staff, until growth returns to the industry
Bedstabilisstability in 
business.
velo
Year on year turnover ran fractionally behind previous year, at £44.7m vs £45.8 in 2020 (-2.4%) with almost all of this
impacting on GP £6.0m vs £6.9m in 2020 (-13%). Continued tight controls and utilisation of the furlough scheme saw a
year-on-year improvement to operating profit at £398k vs £279k in 2020 (+42.7%).
Suppliers were paid on an average of 47 days during the year (+10 days vs 2020 - currently back at average 37 days).
Trade debtor receipts also pushed out to an average of 40 days (+10 days vs 2020 currently back at average 33 days)
as the sales mix of retail and food service shifted back towards the latter. Non-essential capex spend was put on hold so
investment in the year amounted to just £78k.
Key performance indicators
The main key performance indicators remain as profitability and cash flow. Both bottom line profitability and cash
improved year on year, while ensuring all debt servicing requirements were achieved.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2021
S172 Statement
The business considers the views and needs of its stakeholders in all long-term decision making as well as the
consequences of these decisions across the entire company.
•
The likely consequences of any decision in the long term
The directors of the group operate a fluid, fast acting business model where scenarios are mapped out and decision
made quickly. This ensures that long term growth and security is maintained, such as the temporary closing of business
units and aggressive furloughing of staff during the pandemic lockdowns.
•
The interests of the group's employees
The group values its employees as its best asset and encourage employee participation wherever possible. We have a
track record of promoting from within and actively offer training opportunities in specialist areas as well as apprenticeship
development.
•
The need to foster the group's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
The group engages with all external stakeholders through supply chain audits and ensuring both Underwood Meat and its
partners adhere to CSR policies. This helps to strengthen long term business relationships in addition to enhancing the
long-term decision-making process.
The impact of the group's operations on the community and the environment
The group tries where possible to employ from the local community. To minimise its environment impact, the group has
introduced a number of initiatives to encourage the reduction of waste and recycle where possible.
•
The desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
The group strives to maintain its reputation for high standards by adhering to its Conflicts of Interest policy and actively
promoting anonymous whistleblowing via a dedicated line and feedback boxes. This ensures conduct, governance,
integrity and ethics are maintained throughout.
• The need to act fairly as between members of the group
As a privately owned group, the shareholders are equally split between 2 families. All decisions are agreed accordingly at
board level with the group Finance Director to ensure fair balance, integrity and a strong level of corporate governance.

UNDERWOOD MEAT COMPANY LIMITED
DIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2021
Statement of directors' responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors' Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a truc and fair view of the state of affairs of the company
and of the profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required
to:
- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
- make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
- state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed
and expla in the financial state
-prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and
enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud
and other irregularities.
Statement of disclosure to auditor
So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the company's auditor is unaware. Additionally, the directors individually have taken all the necessary
steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of all relevant audit information and to
establish that the company's auditor is aware of that information.

UNDERWOOD MEAT COMPANY LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF UNDERWOOD MEAT COMPANY LIMITED
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Underwood Meat Company Limited (the 'company') for the year ended 31
October 2021 which comprise the statement of comprehensive income, the balance sheet, the statement of changes in
equity, the statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The
financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
•
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the company's affairs as at 31 October 2021 and of its profit for the year
then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAS (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in
the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern for a
period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a
material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
• the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
-6-
UNDERWOOD MEAT COMPANY LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBERS OF UNDERWOOD MEAT COMPANY LIMITED
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit,
we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you
if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or
the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
certain disclosures of remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the Directors Responsibilities Statement set out on page 3, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal
control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company's ability to continue as a
going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of
accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAS (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.
We gained an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the company and the industry in which it
operates, and considered the risk of such regulations, including fraud. We designed audit procedures to respond to the
risk, recognising that the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting
one resulting from error.
We focussed on laws and regulations relevant to the company which could give rise to a material misstatement in the
financial statements. Our testing included discussions with management and directors with direct responsibility for the
compliance of laws and regulations and agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation.
There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described and, the further removed non-compliance with laws and
regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become
aware of it.
As part of our audit, we addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing of journals and
review of the nominal ledger. We evaluated whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of
material misstatement due to fraud.
A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

UNDERWOOD MEAT COMPANY LIMITED
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 OCTOBER 2021
1
Accounting policies
Company information
Underwood Meat Company Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and Wales. The
registered office is 15 Ashley Business Court, Rawmarsh Rd, Rotherham, S60 1RU.
1.1
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 ""The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland"" (""FRS 102"") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary a
mounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below.
This company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, being a member of a group where the parent of
that group prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements, including this company, which are intended
to give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group. The company
has therefore taken advantage of exemptions from the following disclosure requirements:
•
Section 7 'Statement of Cash Flows' - Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and
disclosures;
• Section 33 'Related Party Disclosures' - Compensation for key management personnel.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption under section 400 of the Companies Act 2006 not to prepare
consolidated accounts. The financial statements present information about the company as an individual entity and
not about its group.
Underwood Meat Company Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of Underwood Meat (Holdings) Limited and the
results of Underwood Meat Company Limited are included in the consolidated financial statements of Underwood
Meat (Holdings) Limited which are available from its registered office or can be obtained from Companies House.
1.2
Going concern
At the time of approving the financial statements, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company has
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus the directors continue to
adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
1.3
Turnover
Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided
in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of
consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods
have passed to the buyer (usually on dispatch of the goods), the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is
probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity and the costs incurred or
to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

Accounting policies

1.4
Intangible fixed assets - goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of unincorporated businesses over the fair value of net
assets acquired. It is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is considered to have a finite useful life and is amortised
on a systematic basis over its expected life, which is 10 years.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit from
the acquisition. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of
the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
1.5
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:
Freehold land and buildings
2% - 5% straight line
over the term of the lease
Leasehold land and buildings
Plant and machinery
10%-25% straight line
Motor vehicles
25% straight line
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and
the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.
1.6
Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss.
1.7
Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost comprises
direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing
the stocks to their present location and condition.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks over its
estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or loss.
Reversals of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.
1.8
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash at bank and in hand are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and
bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.

1.9
Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 'Basic Financial Instruments and Section 12 'Other
Financial Instruments Issues' of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there is
a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Basic financial assets
Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction
price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method
unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value
of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one
year are not amortised.
Other financial assets
Other financial assets, including investments in equity instruments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint
ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price. Such assets are subsequently
carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, except that investments in equity
instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured reliably are measured at cost
less impairment.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of
impairment at each reporting end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected. If an
asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the
estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in
profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are
settled, or when the company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership
to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has
transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.
Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.

Accounting policies
(Continued)
Basic financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans and loans from fellow group companies are initially
recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt
instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments discounted at a market rate of interest.
Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction price
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Other financial liabilities
Debt instruments that do not meet the conditions in FRS 102 paragraph 11.9 are subsequently measured at fair
value through profit or loss. Debt instruments may be designated as being measured at fair value though profit or
loss to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch or if the instruments are measured and their performance
evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company's contractual obligations expire or are discharged or
cancelled.
1.10 Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
1.11 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in
the profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future
taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from the
initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting
profit.
1.12 Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock.
1.13 Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.

1.14 Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership to the lessees. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets at the lower of the assets fair value at the date of
inception and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The related liability is included in the balance
sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The
interest is charged to profit or loss so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of
the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed.
1.15 Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable
assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.
A grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised in income when the performance conditions are met.
Where a grant does not specify performance conditions it is recognised in income when the proceeds are received
or receivable. A grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability.
1.16 Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates
of the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign
currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on translation
in the period are included in profit or loss.
2
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the
period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
(Continued)
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities are as follows.
Stock provision
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The directors will assess the requirement for any
provision for obsolete stock, stock utilisation patterns, regular inspection and counting of physical items.
Bad debt provision
Bad debt provisions are stated based upon known situations, such as persistent late payments, credit reference
agency monitoring and regular credit control reviews.

NCR Financial Solutions Group Limited
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2020
1
Accounting policies
Company information
NCR Financial Solutions Group Limited is a private company limited by shares incorporated in England and
Wales. The registered office is 9th Floor, 5 Merchant Square, London, W2 1BQ.
1.1
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 ""The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland"" (""FRS 102"") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary a
mounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £000.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.
This company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FRS 102, being a member of a group where the parent of
that group prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements, including this company, which are
intended to give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group. The
company has therefore taken advantage of exemptions from the following disclosure requirements:
• Section 7 'Statement of Cash Flows': Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and
disclosures;
• Section 11 'Basic Financial Instruments' and Section 12 'Other Financial Instrument Issues': Interest
income/expense and net gains/losses for each category of financial instrument; basis of determining fair
values; details of collateral, loan defaults or breaches, details of hedges, hedging fair value changes
recognised in profit or loss and in other comprehensive income; and
• Section 26 'Share based Payment': Share-based payment expense charged to profit or loss,
reconciliation of opening and closing number and weighted average exercise price of share options, how
the fair value of options granted was measured, measurement and carrying amount of liabilities for
cash-settled share-based payments, explanation of modifications to arrangements.
The financial statements of the company are consolidated in the financial statements of NCR Corporation; a
company incorporated in the USA.
1.2
Going concern
The company meets its day to day working capital requirements through the group banking facility. The current
global economic conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have had a significant impact on the group's
operations. The directors of the company have performed a robust analysis of forecast future cash flows taking
into account the potential impact on the business of possible future scenarios arising from the impact of
COVID-19. This analysis also considers the effectiveness of available measures to assist in mitigating the
impact. The company has also received confirmation of ongoing financial support from its ultimate parent
undertaking, NCR Corporation. Based on these assessments and having regard to the resources available to
the group, the directors have concluded that there is no material uncertainty and that they can continue to adopt
the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.

Accounting policies (continued)
1.3
Turnover
Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services
provided in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair
value of consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.
The company recognises revenue when specific criteria relating to each of the company's sales channels have
been met, as described below.
(i) Research and development, selling and manufacturing
Costs incurred plus a defined uplift which is dependant on the activity that is being performed.
(ii) Software sales
Software revenue is recognised at point of sale. Software maintenance revenue is deferred over the invoice
period and recognised at the point when the maintenance service is provided.
1.4 Intangible fixed assets - goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of unincorporated businesses over the fair value of net
assets acquired. It is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is considered to have a finite useful life
and is amortised on a systematic basis over its expected life, which is 10 years.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit
from the acquisition. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at
least annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable
amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying
of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit
pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
1.5 Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:
20 years
Lease term
Freehold buildings
Leasehold improvements
Plant and equipment
Tooling
2-15 years
2-8 years
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds
and the carrying value of the asset, and is credited or charged to profit or loss.

NCR Financial Solutions Group Limited
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 2020

Accounting policies (continued)
1.6
Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting period end date, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible
assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the
company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects
current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the
estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount,
the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment
loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in
which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Recognised impairment losses are reversed if, and only if, the reasons for the impairment loss have ceased to
apply. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating
unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been
recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised
immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the
reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
1.7
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks,
other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
1.8
Financial instruments
The company has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 'Basic Financial Instruments' and Section 12
*Other Financial Instruments Issues' of FR$ 102 to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the company's balance sheet when the company becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amounts presented in the financial statements, when there
is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis
or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Basic financial assets
Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction
price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest
method unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the
present value of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as
receivable within one year are not amortised.
-16-
NCR Financial Solutions Group Limited
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 2020
1
Accounting policies (continued)
Other financial assets
Other financial assets, including investments in equity instruments which are not subsidiaries, associates or joint
ventures, are initially measured at fair value, which is normally the transaction price. Such assets are
subsequently carried at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss, except that
investments in equity instruments that are not publicly traded and whose fair values cannot be measured
reliably are measured at cost less impairment.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of
impairment at each reporting end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected. If
an asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value
of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is
recognised in profit or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was
recognised, the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed
what the carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The
impairment reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or
are settled, or when the company transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership to another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the
asset has transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.
Classification
financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets
of the company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Basic financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and preference
shares that are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement
constitutes a financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future
payments discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are
not amortised.
Debt instru
ents are subsequently carried
amortised cost, using the eff
tive interest rate method.
Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year
or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction
price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

NCR Financial Solutions Group Limited
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 2020

Accounting policies (continued)
Other financial liabilities
Derivatives, including interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts, are not basic financial
instruments. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and
are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in profit
or loss in finance costs or finance income as appropriate, unless hedge accounting is applied and the hedge is a
cash flow hedge.
Debt instruments that do not meet the conditions in FRS 102 paragraph 11.9 are subsequently measured at fair
value through profit or loss. Debt instruments may be designated as being measured at fair value through profit
or loss to eliminate or reduce an accounting mismatch or if the instruments are measured and their performance
evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the company's contractual obligations expire or are discharged or
cancelled.
1.9
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Dividends payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of
the company.
1.10 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported
in the profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in
other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised
to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other
future taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill
or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor
the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent
that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be
recovered. Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the company has a legally enforceable right to offset current
tax assets and liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax
authority.

Accounting policies (continued)
1.11 Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are
received.
Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed
to terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.
1.12 Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The cost of providing benefits under defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the
projected unit credit method, and is based on actuarial advice.
The change in the net defined benefit liability arising from employee service during the year is recognised as an
employee cost. The cost of plan introductions, benefit changes, settlements and curtailments are recognised as
an expense in measuring profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
The net interest element is determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability by the discount rate, taking
into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability during the period as a result of contribution and
benefit payments. The net interest is recognised in profit or loss as other finance revenue or cost.
Remeasurement changes comprise actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on
the net defined benefit liability excluding amounts included in net interest. These are recognised immediately in
other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not reclassified to profit and loss in
subsequent periods.
The net defined benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the
present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds),
less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on
market price information, and in the case of quoted securities is the published bid price. The value of a net
pension benefit asset is limited to the amount that may be recovered either through reduced contributions or
agreed refunds from the scheme.
1.13 Share-based payments
Where the company participates in a share-based payment arrangement established by a group company the
company takes advantage of the alternative treatment allowed under Section 26 of FRS 102. The company
recognises the share-based payment expense based on an allocation of its share of the group's total expense,
calculated in proportion to the number of participating employees. The corresponding credit is recognised in
retained earnings as a component of equity.

Accounting policies (continued)
When the terms and conditions of equity-settled share-based payments at the time they were granted are
subsequently modified, the fair value of the share-based payment under the original terms and conditions and
under the modified terms and conditions are both determined at the date of the modification. Any excess of the
modified fair value over the original fair value is recognised over the remaining vesting period in addition to the
grant date fair value of the original share-based payment. The share-based payment expense is not adjusted if
the modified fair value is less than the original fair value.
Cancellations or settlements (including those resulting from employee redundancies) are treated as an
acceleration of vesting and the amount that would have been recognised over the remaining vesting period is
recognised immediately.
1.14 Leases
Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss
on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leases asset are consumed.
1.15 Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable
assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.
A grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised in income when the performance conditions are met
. Where a grant does not specify performance conditions it is recognised in income when the proceeds are
received or receivable. A grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability.
1.16 Foreign exchange
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the
dates of the transactions. At each reporting end date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in
foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting end date. Gains and losses arising on
translation in the period are included in profit or loss.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the company's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amount assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors
that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that
period, or in the period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future
periods.
Critical judgements
The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on amounts
recognised in the financial statements.
Share based payments
The company's employees have been granted share options by the ultimate parent, NCR Corporation. The
company makes use of the exemption in Section 26 of FRS102 to account for the expense based on a
reasonable allocation of the parent company's total expense. The company has calculated its allocation of the
parent company's total expense based on the number of participating employees in the company compared to
the number of participating employees in the group.
The company also considered an allocation based on the relative remuneration cost of the relevant employees
and considered that this gave rise to no significant differences in the allocated costs.

Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying
amount of assets and liabilities are as follows.
Useful economic lives of tangible assets
The annual depreciation charge for tangible assets is sensitive to changes in the estimated useful economic
lives and residual values of the assets. The useful economic lives and residual values are reassessed annually.
They are amended when necessary to reflect the current estimates, based on technological advancement, future
investments, economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets.
Impairment of tangible assets
The company makes an assessment whether there are any indicators assets may be impaired. This ensures
tangible assets are not carried at more than their recoverable amount.
Impairment of debtors
The company makes an estimate of the recoverable value of trade, intercompany and other debtors. When
assessing impairment of debtors, management considers factors including the current credit rating of the debtor,
the ageing profile of debtors, historical experience and other known information.
Defined benefit pension scheme
The company has an obligation to pay pension benefits to certain employees. The costs of these benefits and
the present value of the obligation depend on a number of factors, including; life expectancy, salary increases,
asset valuations and the discount rate on corporate bonds. Management estimates these factors in determining
the net pension obligation in the balance sheet. The assumptions reflect historical experience and current
trends.
Onerous Leases
Provision has been made for anticipated rents payable on vacant property leases. The vacant properties are not
currently being marketed and no sub tenants are in place and so no recognition has been made of expected
rents receivable in the calculation of the provision. Therefore, the provision represents the full liability.

The Finance (No.2) Act 2015 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 19% and this was effective from 1
April 2017. A further reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 17% was expected to come into effect from 1
April 2020 (as enacted by the Finance Act 2016 on 15 September 2016). However, legislation introduced in the
Finance Act 2020 (enacted on 22 July 2020) repealed the reduction of corporation tax, maintaining the current
rate of 19%.
On 3 March 2021, the UK Budget 2021 announcements included measures to support economic recovery as a
result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These included an increase to the UK's main corporation tax rate to
25%, which is due to be effective from 1 April 2023. The impact of the change in tax rate from 19% to 25% on
the year end deferred tax position would be an increase in the liability of £4,039,000.

Retirement benefit schemes
The group operates a hybrid pension plan for its employees in the UK. Members' benefits are a combination of
both defined benefit and defined contribution elements. The defined benefit element provides retirement benefits
on the basis of members' final salary. On 15 July 2004, the defined benefit pension scheme element was closed
to new entrants. Employees who joined the company subsequently had acess to a new defined contribution
scheme. The Plan closed to future accrual as at 30 November 2015.

Retirement benefit schemes (continued)
The equity instruments held in the plan assets are quoted and are valued at current bid price following adoption
of the amendment to Section 28 'Retirement Benefits. This adoption took place in both 2019 and 2018.
The actual return on plan assets was £66,651,000 (2019 - £64,523,000).
Scheme assets do not include any of NCR Financial Solutions Group Limited's own financial instruments, or any
property occupied by NCR Financial Solutions Group Limited.
To develop the expected long-term rate of retum on assets assumption, the company considered the current
level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk
premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future
returns of each class net of expenses. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the
target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return of assets assumption for the portfolio.
The total current service income/cost for 2020 and 2019 is included in cost of sales.
The company expects to contribute £5,000,000 to the pension plan in 2021 (2019 - £1,344,000 expected
contributions for 2020).

Share-based payment transactions
Certain employees of the company along with other group employees have been granted options over the
shares in NCR Corporation. The options are granted with a fixed exercise price, are exercisable three years after
the date of grant and expire five years after the date of grant. Employees are required to remain in employment
with the group. The group makes annual grants in February each year.
On exercise of the shares by the employees, the company is charged the intrinsic value of the shares by NCR
Corporation. Payments of £1,476,000 (2019 - £1,449,000) were recognised directly in equity.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MAY 2021
The directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 May 2021.
Fair review of the business
Having recorded a very successful 2019/20, the Board set a considerably reduced Plan for the entire Group as the
growing magnitude and significance of the coronavirus pandemic made itself evident entering the new financial year.
The Group is in a strong financial position at the end of the year with shareholders' funds increasing from £53.8m to
£55.7m. Return on capital employed has changed from 13% to 5%. Return on capital employed is calculated as profit
before tax divided by opening capital employed.
Starting 2020, Brexit had been the initial concern based on the high levels of international business managed by parts of
the Group, but Covid issues dominated.
Whilst the differing sizes, services and product offerings of the Group has traditionally dictated a more individual
summary of annual performance, it is true to say, that on this occasion, every company faced the same pandemi
challenges and enacted similar actions and responses.
Special Steels Ltd, Special Testing Ltd, Special Quality Alloys Ltd and Special Machined Products Ltd all called upon the
centralised Group administration services of finance, HR, H&S and I.T. to devise and support the introduction of protocols
aimed at maintaining employee safety and mitigating the spread of COVID to limit operational disruption.
The avoidance of a 'Lockdown' was key to achieving our financial goals, combined with a strong focus on maintaining
liquidity, preserving and generating cash and optimizing our cost structure to meet dramatically changing customer
demand. Consequently, I am pleased to say that none of our businesses closed throughout the fiscal period and all
remained profitable.
There was also some highlights, Special Quality Alloys completed the commissioning of its largest forging facility, adding
much increased size capabilities, whilst its Houston facility actually increased its profitability ratio. The expected 'Brexit
problem' caused initial logistical transport issues, but actually had a very limited impact on turnover levels.
Special Steels continued its programme of furnace upgrades, developed a new digital pricing structure and launched
new low cost service provider in VHT.
Special Testing managed to offset some of the loss of intercompany work with a noticeable increase in orders from
outside the traditional Sheffield City region.
Special Machined Products had a better than expected year, driven by a combination of swift cost reduction and
diversification from traditional markets. Its turnover / profit ratio improved significantly, allowing it to record an almost
identical performance to the previous financial year.
The Board considers the year to have been a qualified success in the face of unexpected adversity.
Moreover, the Board remains focused on being 'recovery ready' and we expect a number of the pandemic cost reduction
initiatives to become embedded in our daily operational performance as we return to growth in the near term.
The Board considers the business outlook remains positive as the world economy opens back up and demand for energy
increases. However, any plans for future development of the business may be subject to unforeseen events outside of
our control.

applicant concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is made to ensure that their
employment within the group continues and that the appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the group that the
training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other
employees.
Employee involvement
The group's policy is to consult and discuss with employees, through unions, staff councils and at meetings, matters likely

achieve a common awareness on the part of all employees of the financial and economic factors affecting the group's
performance.

efficient lighting as bulbs and fittings are replaced and completed an extension to the bank of vehicle charging points.
These charging points will continue to be extended through 2021-2022 as more electric vehicles are added to the fleet.
Statement of disclosure to auditor
So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the auditor of the company is unaware. Additionally, the directors individually have taken all the
necessary steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of all relevant audit
information and to establish that the auditor of the company is aware of that information.

Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and
company, and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are
required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the ;

and company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and
company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also

SPECIAL STEEL CO., LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF SPECIAL STEEL CO., LIMITED
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Special Steel Co. Limited (the parent company') and its subsidiaries (the
'group') for the year ended 31 May 2021 which comprise the group profit and loss account, the group statement of
comprehensive income, the group balance sheet, the company balance sheet, the group statement of changes in equity,
the company statement of changes in equity, the group statement of cash flows, the company statement of cash flows
and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The
Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and the parent company's affairs as at 31 May 2021 and of
the group's profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
•
•
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAS (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in
the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a
material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.

Opinions other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
•
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you
if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
•
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the parent
company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations,
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAS (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The
extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below.

SPECIAL STEEL CO., LIMITED
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)

•
Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Our approach to identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud
and non-compliance with laws and regulations, was as follows:
the engagement partner ensured that the engagement team collectively had the appropriate competence,
capabilities and skills to identify or recognise non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations;
we identified the laws and regulations applicable to the group through discussions with management, and from our
commercial knowledge and experience of the steel manufacturing and treatment and coating of metals sector;
wc focused on specific laws and regulations which we considered may have a direct material effect on the financial
statements or the operations of the group, including Companies Act 2006, taxation legislation, data protection,
anti-bribery, employment, environments and health and safety legislation;
we assessed the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations identified above through making enquiries of
management and inspecting legal correspondence; and
• identified laws and regulations were communicated within the audit team regularly and the team remained alert to
instances of non-compliance throughout the audit.
•
•
We assessed the susceptibility of the groups financial statements to material misstatement, including obtaining an
understanding of how fraud might occur, by:
• making enquiries of management as to where they considered there was susceptibility to fraud, their knowledge of
actual, suspected and alleged fraud;
• considering the internal controls in place to mitigate risks of fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations;
and
To address the risk of fraud through management bias and override of controls, we:
• performed analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships;
tested journal entries to identify unusual transactions;
assessed whether judgements and assumptions made in determining accounting estimates were indicative of
potential bias;
• investigated the rationale behind significant or unusual transactions; and
•
In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we designed procedures which
included, but were not limited to:
• agreeing financial statement disclosures to underlying supporting documentation;
• enquiring of management as to actual and potential litigation and claims;
• reviewing correspondence with HMRC
There are inherent limitations in our audit procedures described above. The more removed that laws and regulations are
from financial transactions, the less likely it is that we would become aware of non-compliance. Auditing standards also
limit the audit procedures required to identify non-compliance with laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and
other management and the inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.
Material misstatements that arise due to fraud can be harder to detect than those that arise from error as they may involve
deliberate concealment or collusion.
A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

STRATEGIC REPORT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021
The directors present the
tegic report for the year ended 30 September 2021.
Principal activities
The principal activity of the group in the year under review was the collection, recycling and production of resources in
addition to other ancillary services.
Waste collection services are provided to the hospitality, retail, commercial, industrial and construction industries.
Waste such as glass, food, dry mixed recycling, general residual, cardboard, paper, plastics, inert demolition spoil, soils,
wood, green garden, asbestos, incinerator bottom ash, household, road sweepings, civic amenity is collected. This is
undertaken by the fleet of trade refuse vehicles, skips, tippers, grabs and articulated vehicles which transport it to the
Material Recycling Facilities.
Valuable products cardboard, paper, washed sands & gravels, concrete, metals, refuse derived fuel, biomass, topsoil
and animal bedding - are produced.
Headquartered in Midlothian, in central Scotland, the business services all of Scotland and the North East of England from
ten sites.
Review of business performance
The group achieved turnover of £41.7m (2020: £32.7m) in the year; an increase of 28%. This generated an operating
profit of £2.6m (2020: an operating loss of £1.9m) and a profit after tax of £1.4m (2020: a loss after tax £1.9m).
The financial results continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 virus and the associated level of uncertainty within the
UK economy - we entered Q1 amid a national circuit breaker before the elongated national lockdown in our Q2. In H2, the
business was also affected by the national driver shortage as well as disruption to the supply chain of both the business
and our customers.
Despite this, a strong trading performance was seen in FY21. The business continued the robust recovery, building on the
earlier resilience which facilitated the growth in the year. A substantial number of new customer wins contributing
significant recurring revenue, fuelled the higher level of sales with improved margins driven by the new recycling
equipment at our Edinburgh facility.
The acquisition and integration of the business and assets of J&J Stanley in Q3 expedited the growth of the Newcastle
operations through increased capacity from both a larger site and additional plant and equipment suitable for scalable
processing.
Key Performance Indicators (""KPIs"")
One of the main tools to address risk is through the extensive use of KPIs and continuous commercial planning within a 5
year strategic framework. As part of a rolling monthly performance cycle framework the company monitors KPIs such as
new business pipeline, service levels, collection movements, utilisation, collected tonnages, plant throughput, profitability
and liquidity on a daily and weekly basis which are reviewed operationally and at board level.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The nature of the company's business and strategy are subject to a number of risks. The directors are of the opinion that
the risk management processes adopted assist to identify, monitor and ultimately mitigate all the risks.

(PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE NWH GROUP LIMITED)
STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021
Risk Management Commitees
The company operates a Risk, Health and Safety Committee with the purpose of reviewing and making recommendations
on the adequacy and reliability of risk identification, mitigation and reporting. It fulfils the Board's corporate governance
and supervisory responsibility for risk, health and safety and for developing policy to ensure best practice as well as the
health and wellbeing of staff, contractors and visitors to the sites.
The committee meets quarterly ensuring the objectives, measures and targets of the company's policy are appropriate,
adhered to and reported on. Risks addressed include regulatory, people & safety, business continuity, legal, reputational,
environmental and community. A risk management plan is prepared and reviewed annually.
The Safety, Health, Environment, Fire and Quality Committee meets monthly and comprises all site managers. Its findings
feed into the monthly Operational and Main Board meetings as well as the Risk, Health and Safety Committee.
The principal risks and uncertainties that affect the business are:
COVID-19
The company's trading operations in the early part of the year to September 2022 were adversely affected (to a limited
extent) by the Covid-19 pandemic primarily through the interruption to operations caused by an absence of staff
(suppliers, customers and our own) contracting the virus. Since then, the risks associated with the pandemic have eased.
The company continues to ensure best practice precautions are continuously communicated to, and applied with, our
staff.
Compliance
This is the largest risk facing the business whether it is from health and safety legalisation, environmental regulation or
vehicular rules. Compliance has maximum focus in the business and is addressed through constant review and can be
seen in the company's core values. The Compliance Director sits on the Board with responsibility for delivering a fully
compliant business.
Macroeconomic climate
A challenging economic environment has been created by the conflict in Ukraine, Brexit and the pandemic. The
company's strategy is robust enough to counter these headwinds.
Environment
The company is cognisant of its environmental responsibilities and processes and systems are in place to manage the
impact on, as well as protect and enhance, the environment. There is strict adherence to the SEPA and EA waste
management regulations.
Credit risk
The company's principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade debtors. The company's credit risk is
primarily attributable to its trade debtors. Credit Risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and duration of
exposure to any one customer. Trade debtors are insured on an individual account basis. The amounts presented in the
balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, estimated by company's management based on prior experiences
and their assessment of the current environment.
Liquidity risk
The financial risk management policy is to ensure continuity of funding for operations via facilities where limits have been
established based on growth requirements of the business, together with inter-company debt and through acquiring an
element of the Group's fixed assets under finance leases as appropriate. The group has an Invoice Finance Facility with
RBS, providing flexibility to meet the growth requirements of the business. No treasury transactions or derivatives are
entered into.

STRATEGIC REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021
Legislation
Waste recycling is an increasingly regulated sector which can impact the revenue opportunities. The Scottish Government
and its delivery body, Zero Waste Scotland, have introduced ambitious waste recycling policies such as waste reduction
targets for food, the introduction of Deposit Return Scheme for glass bottles and plastic containers and a landfill ban on
municipal biodegradable waste by 2025. Major Scottish cities are introducing Low Emission Zones from mid-2022 which
are designed to target the most polluting vehicles; our fleet has been modernised to ensure it is compliant with the new
regulations. The business has visibility of changes to the legal environment and the prevailing political sentiment and
plans accordingly.
Human resources
People are the company's greatest asset and there is a continuing reliance on high calibre employees as the business
grows. To deliver this, investment has been and will continue to be made to increase capacity and capability through the
business. In addition, the apprenticeship program ensures the business has a process to meet the constant nccd for high
quality drivers.
End markets
The company operates in the construction sector which has experienced challenges in previous years. The risk faced by
the company is significantly diversified as there is increasing sales activity in other markets cg hospitality, local
government, facilities management, manufacturing, industrial, commercial, retail and leisure.
Commodities market
Volatility in global commodity prices can impact the revenues generated from the resource produced. Working with
industry partners helps to mitigate any downside risk.
Business infrastructure
The business is reliant on various software and IT systems. Further improvements to our operational systems continued
to be implemented throughout the business offering greater stability, analysis and reporting capability.
Acquisitions
A key plank of the growth strategy is through acquisitions. In the year, the business and assets of J&J Stanley Limited
were acquired. There are many potential deals sourced and only those that are aligned to the strategy of, and have a
strong culture fit with, NWH are progressing. This disciplined approach limits the risk of poor integration.
2022 Outlook
Building on the progress made in 2021, the focus for FY22 is delivering growth through continued increase in sales and
margin improvement. The main drivers will be the full year benefit of revenues acquired in FY21 as well as the enlarged
Newcastle operations and more efficient waste and aggregate processing.
As part of our Operational Excellence operating model, we have recruited a new Operations Director, Sean Harley. He will
lead increased efficiency through our processes and structures and new technologies.
In October 2021, we restructured the business into one trading entity, NWH Group Limited (formerly NWH Waste Services
Limited). This is the foundation to move to one operational system which will give one service delivery platform making us
easier to buy from and drive further automation and integration.
As part of the strategic goal to become a more sustainable business, we are investing in new aggregate processing plant.
It will provide a significant capability upgrade delivering incremental revenues and margins and reducing landfill.
Acquisition targets which meet the business' strategy and culture will continue to be actively pursued.

Communication with employees is vital and an open approach is taken. There is regular email correspondence to all staff
detailing the latest business activity, news (prior to public release), CSR activity and recruitment. Periodic updates to
drivers, through in-vehicle software, focuses on business updates and safety campaigns. The internal Facebook page
gives a platform for two-way communication. In addition, there are monthly business reviews and Q&A sessions, for
drivers and non-drivers, which provides direct access to the CEO to respond to queries and outline plans for the business.

DIRECTORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021
Statement of directors' responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors
have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not approve
the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a truc and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and
company, and of the profit or loss of the group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are
required to:
select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the ;
prepare the on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and company will
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the group's
and company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and
company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Strategic report
The group has chosen in accordance with Companies Act 2006, s. 414C(11) to set out in the group's strategic report
information required by Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, Sch.
7 to be contained in the directors' report. It has done so in respect of financial instruments and risk.
Statement of disclosure to auditor
So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit
information of which the auditor of the company is unaware. Additionally, the directors individually have taken all the
necessary steps that they ought to have taken as directors in order to make themselves aware of all relevant audit
information and to establish that the auditor of the company is aware of that information.

NWH HOLDINGS LIMITED
(PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE NWH GROUP LIMITED)
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF NWH HOLDINGS LIMITED
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of NWH Holdings Limited (the parent company') and its subsidiaries (the
'group') for the year ended 30 September 2021 which comprise the group statement of comprehensive income, the group
balance sheet, the company balance sheet, the group statement of changes in equity, the company statement of changes
in equity, the group statement of cash flows and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting
policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic
of Ircland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion the financial statements:
give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and the parent company's affairs as at 30 September 2021
and of the group's profit for the year then ended;
have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
•
•
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAS (UK)) and applicable law. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our
other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in
the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions
that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant
sections of this report.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our
auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly
stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other
information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements
or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a
material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that
there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.
We have nothing to report in this regard.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBERS OF NWH HOLDINGS LIMITED
•
Opinions other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of our audit:
the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.
•
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the
course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you
if, in our opinion:
adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or
we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
•
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the parent
company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using
the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations,
or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with
ISAS (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
A further description of our responsibilities is available on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.

NWH HOLDINGS LIMITED
(PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE NWH GROUP LIMITED)
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)
TO THE MEMBERS OF NWH HOLDINGS LIMITED
Extent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line
with our responsibilities, outlined above and on the Financial Reporting Council's website, to detect material
misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.
We obtain and update our understanding of the entity, its activities, its control environment, and likely future
developments, including in relation to the legal and regulatory framework applicable and how the entity is complying with
that framework. Based on this understanding, we identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. This includes consideration of the risk
of acts by the entity that were contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud.
In response to the risk of irregularities and non-compliance with laws and regulations, including fraud, we designed
procedures which included:
• Enquiry of management and those charged with governance around actual and potential litigation and claims as
well as actual, suspected and alleged fraud;
• Reviewing minutes of meetings of those charged with governance;
• Assessing the extent of compliance with the laws and regulations considered to have a direct material effect on the
financial statements or the operations of the entity through enquiry and inspection;
• Reviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with
applicable laws and regulations;
Performing audit work over the risk of management bias and override of controls, including testing of journal
entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, evaluating the business rationale of significant transactions
outside the normal course of business and reviewing accounting estimates for indicators of potential bias.
•
Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those
leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the
more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial
statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk of not detecting a material
misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,
intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

NWH HOLDINGS LIMITED
(PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE NWH GROUP LIMITED)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021
1
Accounting policies
Company information
NWH Holdings Limited (""the company"") is a private limited company domiciled and incorporated in Scotland. The
registered office is Unit 5 Mayfield Industrial Estate, Mayfield, Dalkeith, Midlothian, EH22 4AD.
1.1
Accounting convention
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 102 ""The Financial Reporting Standard
applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland"" (""FRS 102"") and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The financial statements are prepared in sterling, which is the functional currency of the company. Monetary a
mounts in these financial statements are rounded to the nearest £.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. The principal accounting
policies adopted are set out below.
The company is a qualifying entity for the purposes of FR$ 102, being a member of a group where the parent of
that group prepares publicly available consolidated financial statements, including this company, which are
intended to give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group. The
company has therefore taken advantage of exemptions from the following disclosure requirements for parent
company information presented within the consolidated financial statements:
Section 7 'Statement of Cash Flows': Presentation of a statement of cash flow and related notes and
•
disclosures;
• Section 11 'Basic Financial Instruments' and Section 12 'Other Financial Instrument Issues: The disclosure
requirements of paragraphs 11.42, 11.44, 11.45, 11.47, 11.48(a)(iii), 11.48(a)(iv), 11.48(b), 11.48(c), 12.26,
12.27, 12.29(a), 12.29(b), and 12.29A;
• Section 26 'Share based Payment': Share based payment arrangements required under FRS 102
paragraphs 26.18(b), 26.19 to 26.21 and 26.23;
• Section 33 'Related Party Disclosures': Compensation for key management personnel.
1.2
Basis of consolidation
In the parent company financial statements, the cost of a business combination is the fair value at the acquisition
date of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed, plus costs directly
attributable to the business combination. The excess of the cost of a business combination over the fair value of
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is recognised as goodwill. The cost of the
combination includes the estimated amount of contingent consideration that is probable and can be measured
reliably, and is adjusted for changes in contingent consideration after the acquisition date. Provisional fair values
recognised for business combinations in previous periods are adjusted retrospectively for final fair values
determined in the 12 months following the acquisition date. Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and
associates are accounted for at cost less impairment.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the value of assets (other than goodwill) and liabilities
recognised in a business combination accounted for using the purchase method and the amounts that can be
deducted or assessed for tax, considering the manner in which the carrying amount of the asset or liability is
expected to be recovered or settled. The deferred tax recognised is adjusted against goodwill or negative goodwill.

NWH HOLDINGS LIMITED
(PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS THE NWH GROUP LIMITED)
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021
1
Accounting policies
(Continued)
The consolidated group financial statements consist of the financial statements of the parent company NWH
Holdings Limited together with all entities controlled by the parent company (its subsidiaries) and the group's share
of its interests in joint ventures and associates.
All financial statements are made up to 30 September 2021. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other
members of the group.
All intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are
eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred.
In prior years, the group's Other capital reserve was incorrectly classified to the Capital redemption reserve. As
such, the comparatives presented for the prior year have been restated to correct this allocation. This is a
reclassification adjustment within equity only and does not impact the previously reported results or net assets.
1.3
Going concern
The directors are required to prepare the statutory financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the group will continue in business. The directors' assessment of going concern
considers the group's principal risks and is dependent on a number of factors including financial performance and
access to funding facilities.
Subsequent to the year end, the group restructured its bank facilities, replacing its current loans with two new
loans, which expire in 2026 and 2027, and agreeing a reduction to its revolving credit facility. The group also
entered into discussions with its finance provider to obtain a bank covenant waiver and an amendment to its bank
covenants in respect of future periods. The group's finance provider continues to be supportive of the group and
the directors expect both to be approved in due course.
The directors have prepared detailed financial projections for a period extending over 12 months from the date of
approval of these financial statements. These projections have also been sensitised to reflect plausible downside
scenarios. Based on these projections, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate
resources with sufficient levers available to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and to meet
its obligations as they fall due.
1.4
Taking all of the above into account, the directors consider that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements
on the going concern basis.
Turnover
Turnover is recognised at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided
in the normal course of business, and is shown net of VAT and other sales related taxes. The fair value of
consideration takes into account trade discounts, settlement discounts and volume rebates.
When cash inflows are deferred and represent a financing arrangement, the fair value of the consideration is the
present value of the future receipts. The difference between the fair value of the consideration and the nominal
amount received is recognised as interest income.
Revenue relates to the collection and processing of materials, sale of recycled materials and skip hire.
Revenue from collection services is recognised when the materials have been collected and the loads weighed
upon return to the processing facility. Revenue from processing services is recognised at the point in time when the
processing service takes place. Revenue from the sale of recycled materials is recognised when the significant
risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have transferred to the buyer. Turnover from skip hire is recognised
on despatch of the skip to the customer.

1.5
Intangible fixed assets - goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition of a business over the fair value of net assets acquired. It
is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is considered to have a finite useful life and is amortised on a systematic
basis over its expected life, which is ten years.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units expected to benefit from
the acquisition. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment at least
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of
the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce
the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
1.6
Intangible fixed assets other than goodwill
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at
cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired on business combinations are recognised separately from goodwill at the acquisition
date where it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the
entity and the fair value of the asset can be measured reliably; the intangible asset arises from contractual or other
legal rights; and the intangible asset is separable from the entity.
Amortisation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:
Software
33% on cost
1.7
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost or valuation, net of
depreciation and any impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets less their residual values over their
useful lives on the following bases:
Freehold land and buildings
2% on cost
20% on cost
Leasehold land and buildings
Plant and equipment
Computer equipment
10-20% on cost
33% on cost
Motor vehicles
20% on cost
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sale proceeds and
the carrying value of the asset, and is recognised in the profit and loss account.
1.8
Fixed asset investments
In the parent company financial statements, investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities
are initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies
of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

1.9
Impairment of fixed assets
At each reporting period end date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if
any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the company estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The carrying amount of the investments accounted for using the equity method is tested for impairment as a single
asset. Any goodwill included in the carrying amount of the investment is not tested separately for impairment.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future
cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the
carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case
the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
1.10 Stocks
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell. Cost comprises
direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing
the stocks to their present location and condition.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made for impairment. Any excess of the carrying amount of stocks over
its estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or loss.
Reversals of impairment losses are also recognised in profit or loss.
1.11 Cash at bank and in hand
Cash and cash equivalents are basic financial assets and include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks,
other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. Bank
overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
1.12 Financial instruments
The group has elected to apply the provisions of Section 11 'Basic Financial Instruments' and Section 12 'Other
Financial Instruments Issues' of FRS 102 to all of its financial instruments.
Financial instruments are recognised in the group's balance sheet when the group becomes party to the
contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amounts presented in the financial statements when there is a
legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Basic financial assets
Basic financial assets, which include debtors and cash and bank balances, are initially measured at transaction
price including transaction costs and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method
unless the arrangement constitutes a financing transaction, where the transaction is measured at the present value
of the future receipts discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial assets classified as receivable within one
year are not amortised.

Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit and loss, are assessed for indicators of
impairment at each reporting end date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that
occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected. If an
asset is impaired, the impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of the
estimated cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The impairment loss is recognised in
profit or loss.
If there is a decrease in the impairment loss arising from an event occurring after the impairment was recognised,
the impairment is reversed. The reversal is such that the current carrying amount does not exceed what the
carrying amount would have been, had the impairment not previously been recognised. The impairment reversal is
recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
Financial assets are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are
settled, or when the group transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to
another entity, or if some significant risks and rewards of ownership are retained but control of the asset has
transferred to another party that is able to sell the asset in its entirety to an unrelated third party.
Classification of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual
arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of
the group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Basic financial liabilities
Basic financial liabilities, including creditors, bank loans, loans from fellow group companies and preference shares
that are classified as debt, are initially recognised at transaction price unless the arrangement constitutes a
financing transaction, where the debt instrument is measured at the present value of the future payments
discounted at a market rate of interest. Financial liabilities classified as payable within one year are not amortised.
Debt instruments are subsequently carried at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Trade creditors are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of
business from suppliers. Amounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or
less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade creditors are recognised initially at transaction price
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the group's contractual obligations expire or are discharged or
cancelled.
1.13 Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Dividends
payable on equity instruments are recognised as liabilities once they are no longer at the discretion of the group.
1.14 Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021

Accounting policies
(Continued)
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in
the profit and loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other
years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group's liability for current tax is
calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting end date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future
taxable profits. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the timing difference arises from goodwill or from
the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the
accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting end date and reduced to the extent that it
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the profit and loss account, except when it relates to items
charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are offset if, and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities
and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority.
1.15 Employee benefits
The costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense, unless those costs are
required to be recognised as part of the cost of stock or fixed assets.
The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are
received.
Termination benefits are recognised immediately as an expense when the company is demonstrably committed to
terminate the employment of an employee or to provide termination benefits.
1.16 Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
1.17 Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership to the lessees. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets at the lower of the assets fair value at the date of
inception and the present value of the minimum lease payments. The ated liability is included in the balance
sheet as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements. The
interest is charged to profit or loss so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of
the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases, including any lease incentives received, are charged to profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

(Continued)
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a street line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the
leased asset and recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
1.18 Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable
assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.
Government grants relating to turnover are recognised as income over the periods when the related costs are
incurred. Grants relating to an asset are recognised in income systematically over the asset's expected useful life.
If part of such a grant is deferred it is recognised as deferred income rather than being deducted from the asset's
carrying amount.
2
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the group's accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are
considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised where the revision affects only that period, or in the
period of the revision and future periods where the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty in applying accounting policies in the financial statements are:
- Useful economic lives of intangible and tangible assets
- Residual values of tangible assets
- Fair value of assets acquired in business combinations
- Bad debt provisioning
- Stock to tip provisioning
The annual amortisation or depreciation charge for intangible and tangible assets is sensitive to changes in the
estimated useful economic lives and residual values of assets. The useful economic lives and residual values are
assessed annually and amended when necessary to reflect current estimates, based on technological
advancements, future investments, economic utilisation and physical condition of the assets.
The directors review the debtors ledger for customers who have overdue balances. Provision are made against
balances which present a credit risk to the company. The directors also monitor customers' insured limits to mitigate
the risk of bad or doubtful debts.
Fair values of assets acquired in business combinations are assessed by management based on their knowledge of
the industry and physical conditions of the assets acquired.
Stock to tip provisions are measured at the directors best estimate the company's obligations in respect of unusable
or unsellable materials held on site.
